of species counted) and Margalef’s index both graphically and statistically shows a clear bias toward HS
method consistently identifying more taxa than corrected CVS method counts (MZ101C/MZ102_C and
MZ103/MZ102_C comparisons). This trend is consitant with previous split sample finding (ICPRB 2000)
and contrary to the belief that the strength of the CVS method was that it allowed for rare and common
abundant species to be enumerated with equal precision (Alden etal 1982) . These analyses also showed
that Simpson’s diversity index and Shannon-Weiner index do not have the same bias. This was not
unexpected because both Simpson’s and Shannon Weiner indexes are based on species proportion as
"part of total abundance, which itself did not show any method biases (ICES, 2000)."
Versar HS vs. ODU HS Count (MZ101C/MZ103) Comparisons
"MZ101C/MZ103 comparisons were based 28 of the 78 recount samples, are denoted as green"
dots in all graphs in Appendix A with accompanying statistics in Appendix C. Overall mesozooplankton
data enumerated by Old Dominion University using Hensen-Stempel methodology are reasonably
"compatible with Versar results. Just like the MZ101C/MZ102_C data, MZ101C/MZ103 also showed"
density decline in common groups below 1000 organisms*m-3 with the same Versar bias. In regards to
"species diversity Versar consistently found more taxa per sample than ODU (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test,"

Refinement of CVS correction Factors
"One short coming of the CVS correction factors developed for the ZIBI (Carpenter etal, 2006) was that"
genus specific correction factors could not be calculated for all major groups due a low number of
organism occurrences in the original 189 ODU Hensen Stempel recount samples. With the addition of
the 72 Versar recounts samples it is possible to refine existing correction factors and calculate taxa
"specific correction factors for Evadne sp., Labidocera sp., Leptodora sp., Podon sp, and Penilia sp.."
Previously these taxa had been lumped into group correction factors. Updated correction factors were
"calculated using the same procedure used in Carpenter et.al. 2006. First, all ""exclusion"" taxa were"
removed from the data set (Table 2). Exclusion taxa are defined as those taxa appearing in the data set
not considered to be true mesozooplankton or plankton not well sampled by bongo net protocols. Counts
of all taxa identified to species were group to genus and summed. CVS and HS data were then matched
"by station, date and taxa. Since zooplankton population usually have an underlying log normal"
"distribution, correction factors were estimated using a log normalized geometric mean procedure"
"(Gilbert,1987). The updated and ZIBI correction factors can be found in Table 3. For taxa groups where"
"sample size was less than 5 in most cases, groups were pooled to calculate order or other higher level"
taxonomic level conversion factor.
