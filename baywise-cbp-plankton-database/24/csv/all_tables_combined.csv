"In the Virginia program, field samples were collected by taking five minute double-oblique pattern"
"bongo net tows from bottom to surface. From1985 to 1992, it is unclear whether or not the bongo nets"
used for field sampling were equipped with flow meters to accurately estimate the volume of water filtered
through the nets during a tow. The volume of water filtered during a tow may have been estimated using
"the length of the tow and area of the net’s opening. In 1993, a flow meter was mounted on the nets. In"
"the laboratory, the Virginia program used several different enumeration techniques. From 1985 to 1997 a"
Controlled Variability Sampling (CVS) method (method MZ102) described by Alden et.al. 1982 was used.
"The CVS technique used a connected series of five wet sieves (200, 300, 600, 850, and 2000 microns)"
and a mechanized shaking apparatus to separate and count zooplankton by size fraction. Split sampling
tests in early 1998 revealed that smaller zooplankton slipped through the last 200 micron sieve and CVS
enumerated samples consistently reported lower plankton densities than the HS enumerated samples
"(ICPRB, 2000). Furthermore, the sieving process appeared to break off fragile plankton appendages"
making taxa identifications more difficult. In March 1998 a 75 micron sieve was added to the sieve stack
in hopes of capturing the smaller plankton lost by the original CVS method (method MZ102B). This
modification to the CVS method was found to be ineffective (ICPRB 2000) and abandoned in favor of the
Hensen-Stempel pipette method which included a macrozooplankton scan and a 850-micron sieve counts
in 2000 (method MZ103). Data enumerated during this period was given a unique method code until its
comprability to other HS enumerated data could be assessed.
"Fortunately, as standard practice in the Virginia program, all original field samples were split into"
"halves, one was enumerated and the other was archived. This presented an opportunity to recount"
archive samples using Hensen-Stempel methodology. Counts from archive samples could fill data gaps
in the historic record created by CVS enumerated samples and allow for the development of correction
"factors to make CVS data comparable with HS enumerated data, thus expanding the historic data record."
"In 2002, Old Dominion University went into the archives and counted 189 archive samples using HS"
technique (Carpenter et. al. 2003). These samples served as the basis to develop the first correction
factors for summer mesohaline and polyhaline CVS (MZ102) enumerated samples (Carpenter et. al
2006). No correction factors have been developed for samples enumerated with method MZ102B.
"When all zooplankton sampling terminated in October 2002, approximately 1,000 archived"
"samples dating from 1996 to 2002 were in storage at Old Dominion University. In 2005, the CBP took"
formal custody of these samples with the intent to enumerate them with the HS pipette sub-sampling
technique. Funding for recounting a portion of the archive samples became available from CBP in early
"2006. Seventy-two archived Virginia mesozooplankton samples were counted by Versar, Inc. Samples"
collected during the summer (July- September) in mesohaline and polyhaline waters were targeted for
counting because the results could be used as validation samples for the Zooplankton Indexes of Biotic
Integrity (ZIBI) which were in various stages of development. These counts also allowed for additional

of species counted) and Margalef’s index both graphically and statistically shows a clear bias toward HS
method consistently identifying more taxa than corrected CVS method counts (MZ101C/MZ102_C and
MZ103/MZ102_C comparisons). This trend is consitant with previous split sample finding (ICPRB 2000)
and contrary to the belief that the strength of the CVS method was that it allowed for rare and common
abundant species to be enumerated with equal precision (Alden etal 1982) . These analyses also showed
that Simpson’s diversity index and Shannon-Weiner index do not have the same bias. This was not
unexpected because both Simpson’s and Shannon Weiner indexes are based on species proportion as
"part of total abundance, which itself did not show any method biases (ICES, 2000)."

Refinement of CVS correction Factors
"One short coming of the CVS correction factors developed for the ZIBI (Carpenter etal, 2006) was that"
genus specific correction factors could not be calculated for all major groups due a low number of
organism occurrences in the original 189 ODU Hensen Stempel recount samples. With the addition of
the 72 Versar recounts samples it is possible to refine existing correction factors and calculate taxa
"specific correction factors for Evadne sp., Labidocera sp., Leptodora sp., Podon sp, and Penilia sp.."
Previously these taxa had been lumped into group correction factors. Updated correction factors were
"calculated using the same procedure used in Carpenter et.al. 2006. First, all ""exclusion"" taxa were"
removed from the data set (Table 2). Exclusion taxa are defined as those taxa appearing in the data set
not considered to be true mesozooplankton or plankton not well sampled by bongo net protocols. Counts
of all taxa identified to species were group to genus and summed. CVS and HS data were then matched
"by station, date and taxa. Since zooplankton population usually have an underlying log normal"
"distribution, correction factors were estimated using a log normalized geometric mean procedure"
"(Gilbert,1987). The updated and ZIBI correction factors can be found in Table 3. For taxa groups where"
"sample size was less than 5 in most cases, groups were pooled to calculate order or other higher level"
taxonomic level conversion factor.
