1.05 / DPMSP * (ETIME-BTIME),
Where,
CARBFIX = Carbon fixation rate in ug C/l/hr,
IVOL = Volume incubated,
FVOL = Volume filtered,
DPMSAM = Disintegrations per minute from incubated sample,DPMSAM = Disintegrations per minute from incubated sample
DPMT0 = Disintegrations per minute from corresponding un-incubated,DPMT0 = Disintegrations per minute from corresponding un-incubated
(time zero - t0) sample,
DPMSP = Total disintegrations per minute for C-14 spike,
BTIME = Beginning time of incubation (h),
ETIME = Ending time of incubation (h),
CARBALK = Total inorganic carbonate from 1),
*Calculation of Assimilation Ratio,
ASMRATIO = CARBFIX / CHLA - this ratio is calculated prior to,ASMRATIO = CARBFIX / CHLA - this ratio is calculated prior to
rounding the CARBFIX value,
Where,
ASMRATIO = Assimilation ratio,
CARBFIX = Carbon fixation in ug C/l/h from 2),
CHLA = Chlorophyll a in ug/l,
