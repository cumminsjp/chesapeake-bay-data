,produce vertical profiles with in vivo fluorescence measured
,every1-3 meters. This level of sampling produces a
,comprehensive data set for chlorophyll.
Sensitivity,The chlorophyll technique which is used at MSUERC is
,sensitive to ~ 1 ug chl/L. Below that level the detection limit
,is exceeded. This has been determined from standards that
,have been run for a variety of different chlorophyll
,concentrations.

Precision,Precision for this metric is determined by the
,carbon:chlorophyll (assimilation ratio) for the two composite
,samples which are collected at each sampling site. Since these
,"composites are not replicates, the way to normalize them"
,relative to carbon fixation (primary productivity) is by using
,the chlorophyll concentrations of the two carboys to calculate
,the assimilation ratio.
Bias,A QA/QC split sample comparison was made with ODU’s
,primary productivity lab in 2002. The results of this split
,sample effort indicated a bias between the two labs that was
,partially attributed to differences in protocols in determining
,carbon fixation rates. A report is on file that documents the
,results of this comparison.
Accuracy,It is difficult to assess the accuracy of this measure since there
,is not a standard to test experimental results against.
Representativeness,"The distribution of sample sites, the variety of biomass"
,conditions and the seasonal array of collections contribute to
,"representativeness. In addition, the replication of composite"
,samples in the euphotic zone aids in compensating for patchy
,distributions of phytoplankton.
Comparability,Inter-lab comparability is accomplished from replicate
,samples which are normalized with chlorophyll concentrations
,to provide an assimilation ratio which should be similar
,between the two replicate composites. Intra-lab comparability
,was assessed in 2002 with a split sample analysis with ODU.
Completeness,Primary productivity measures are taken at the highest
,possible frequency and at all of the primary phytoplankton
,stations in the monitoring program.
