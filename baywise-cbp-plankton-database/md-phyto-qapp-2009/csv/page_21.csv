until the densities compare within the 80% guidelines and these new values are thereby reported.,until the densities compare within the 80% guidelines and these new values are thereby reported.
"Instrument/Equipment Testing, Inspection, Maintenance and Calibration",
Microscopes and light meters are inspected and maintained on an annual basis.,
"Technicians from an optical company come to the laboratory annually to inspect, clean and align","Technicians from an optical company come to the laboratory annually to inspect, clean and align"
the microscopes. This allows for the maintenance of consistently high optical quality in the,
microscopes which are used in the Phytoplankton Monitoring Program. The underwater light,
meters and deck cells are sent back to Li-Cor Corp. annually for inspection and calibration. The,meters and deck cells are sent back to Li-Cor Corp. annually for inspection and calibration. The
three meters are periodically tested against one another to test for potential drift between,
"calibrations. If there is significant drift in a unit (>20%), it is returned to the manufacturer for",
re-calibration.,
The performance of the spectrophotometer used in chlorophyll a analysis is tested,
indirectly during the QA tests run on the chlorophyll protocol. If there is discrepancy in,
"chlorophyll concentrations during inter or intralab QA efforts, the instrument is one of the",
variables which is tested for causing the discrepancy. The interlab QA test for chlorophyll a,
involves use of a chlorophyll standard which acts as a test of the accuracy of the,
spectrophotometer.,
The fluorometers (3) are tested against one another annually and calibrated to give,
readings which are within 10% of one another. The in vivo fluorescence data which is converted,readings which are within 10% of one another. The in vivo fluorescence data which is converted
to chlorophyll a concentrations is somewhat of a relative measure since the IVF data is regressed,to chlorophyll a concentrations is somewhat of a relative measure since the IVF data is regressed
against discrete chlorophyll concentrations. The resulting transformed IVF data rely on the,
chlorophyll a concentrations to provide their accuracies.,
