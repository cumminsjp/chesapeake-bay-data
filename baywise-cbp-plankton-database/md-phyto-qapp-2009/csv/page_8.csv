Precision,The counting technique which is used (Utermohl technique)
,requires a minimum of 200 individual cells to be counted in 10
,random fields at the primary magnification (312.5X). This
,"number of cells produces a precision of 80%, whereby a"
,recount of a sample should produce a total cell density within
,80% of the original count. Inter-lab recounts are done on 10%
,of the samples and the resulting total density must be within
,80% of the original or the re-count is done again until this
,precision is attained.
Bias,Bias within taxonomist is determined by enumerating the same
,samples by different taxonomists. This is done annually
,between the MD taxonomist (MSUERC) and the VA
,taxonomist (ODU) in a split sample program. The results of
,these split sample efforts are documented in reports.
Accuracy,Accuracy has not been tested for phytoplankton enumerations.
,The reason for this is that there is no way to know the
,absolute composition of phytoplankton in a field sample. It
,has been discussed to mix several algal cultures into one
,sample and have a particle counter provide an estimate of the
,"densities of the various algae, but this has not been carried out."
Representativeness,The phytoplankton samples are collected by compositing the
,same volume of water from five distinct depths in replicate.
,The replicate composites are combined and the sample is
,removed from this replicate composite. This enhances the
,representativeness of the sample and is aimed at reducing the
,effects of ‘patchiness’ inherent in phytoplankton populations.
Comparability,The split sample program between MD and VA is aimed at
,producing a Baywide phytoplankton data set which is
,comparable. Many steps have been taken over the years to
,maximize this comparability between the two phytoplankton
,labs.
Completeness,The MD phytoplankton program has recently added four
,additional sampling sites because of incomplete spatial
,coverage. Only the portion of the water column above the
,pycnocline is analyzed because of funding issues. Temporally
,key months are sampled bi-weekly while other months are not
,sampled – this was done because of knowledge gained about
,phytoplankton population dynamics and a recent power
,analysis supported this decision.
