Sensitivity,The measure of productivity is made with stock solution
,which is very concentrated. This enables sufficient readings
,(disintegrations of the radioisotope) to take place during short
,"incubations, when biomass is low and during times of the year"
,when phytoplankton metabolism is inherently low (winter).
