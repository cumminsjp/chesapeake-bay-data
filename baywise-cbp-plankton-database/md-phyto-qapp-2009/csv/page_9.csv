Sensitivity,The enumeration technique employs three different
,magnifications which allows for the detection and optimal
,enumeration of cells of different size and density within a
,sample. A low magnification scan (125X) of the entire
,"chamber provides maximum sensitivity for the rare, larger"
,taxa.

Precision,The chlorophyll technique is standardized within the lab.
,Blanks are run on the spectrophotometer during each set of
,samples. A split sample program has been established
,whereby replicate samples from the same carboy of Bay water
,are sent to 8 different labs for analysis. The comparison of
,these replicate samples allows for an indication of inter-lab
,precision.
Bias,The split sample program previously mentioned enables
,MSUERC to monitor bias in these results since the program is
,carried out 4 times/year over a twenty-five year period. The
,comparison of MSUERC chlorophyll concentrations to other
,labs’ results enables the detection of bias. With detection of
,"bias, there are a series of steps which are taken to attempt to"
,detect the source of the bias.
Accuracy,Chlorophyll standards (known concentration) are periodically
,used to assess the accuracy of the chlorophyll technique.
Representativeness,On many of the cruises chlorophyll samples are filtered
,relative to in vivo fluorescence readings (a unitless measure of
,chlorophyll). These samples are purposefully taken at as wide
,a range of in vivo fluorescence readings as possible which
,thereby provides representativeness relative to a wide range of
,chlorophyll concentrations.
Comparability,Since the split sample program includes 8 different
,"laboratories, comparability of data is tested routinely as part of"
,this program.
Completeness,Chlorophyll samples are taken in conjunction with a
,continuous flow-through measure of in vivo fluorescence at
,the surface of the water column and at each 1-2 meters
,throughout the water column at many sampling sites
,(mainstem Bay and Patuxent River). The other sampling sites
