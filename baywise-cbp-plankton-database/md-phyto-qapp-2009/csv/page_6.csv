temporal patterns and the natural variability inherent in these parameters have been determined.,
There are very distinct patterns over space and time regarding the quantity and quality of the,
plankton populations. The major cause of the natural variability in the patterns in the plankton,
populations of the Bay is the amount of freshwater which enters the ecosystem from year to year.,populations of the Bay is the amount of freshwater which enters the ecosystem from year to year.
"Other factors which contribute to the fluctuations in plankton populations include temperature,",
"salinity and of course, nutrients. The primary factor which man can alter is the amount of",
nutrient that enters the Bay ecosystem.,

populations in Chesapeake Bay.,"More specifically, the objective of this component of the"
Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program is to quantitatively and qualitatively,
characterize the phytoplankton populations in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay and,
several of its tributaries. The qualitative assessment takes place by microscopically enumerating,several of its tributaries. The qualitative assessment takes place by microscopically enumerating
the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton communities. This work allows one to,
determine the quality of the phytoplankton community as it relates to water quality and as food,
"for higher trophic levels. Quantitatively, the communities are analyzed for total biomass",
(chlorophyll a) and photosynthetic rate (primary production measured by the 14 C technique).,
The combination of these parameters allows for the assessment of community health of the,
primary producers. This group is extremely important from the standpoint of monitoring water,
quality since they are the first group to respond to changes in nutrient conditions in the estuary,
"and since they are the base of the food chain, upon which all higher trophic groups ultimately",
depend. The phytoplankton taxonomic data collected in the MD phytoplankton component of,
the program is directly comparable to data collected as part of the VA phytoplankton component,the program is directly comparable to data collected as part of the VA phytoplankton component

Project Description,
The Phytoplankton Component of the Monitoring Program measures phytoplankton,
"species composition abundances, primary productivity and vertical distributions of in vivo",
fluorescence/chlorophyll a at all primary plankton stations and distributions of autotrophic,
picoplankton in the mesohaline portion of the estuary in MD during May-September (Figure 2).,
"In addition, vertical distributions of chlorophyll a are also determined at a series of additional",
stations sampled for water quality by MDDNR in the Patuxent River and Chesapeake Bay.,
Continuous underway measurements of chlorophyll a (horizontal in vivo fluorescence) are also,
made between these MDDNR stations and the primary stations routinely sampled for,
phytoplankton and productivity.,
