Autotrophic Picoplankton,
Phytoplankton populations have been monitored in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries,
"since the outset of the monitoring program in August, 1984. During this time, it has been",
documented in several studies that the picoplankton component of the phytoplankton,

"of their contribution to total cell densities, biomass and primary productivity (Ray et al. 1989;",
Falkenhayn 1990; Lacouture et al. 1990; Affronti and Marshall 1994; Marshall and Nesius,
1996). Virginia incorporated a phototrophic picoplankton component to their monitoring,
program in 1989 and Maryland decided to include this element in the Maryland portion of the,
Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program beginning in 2002.,
"Sampling will occur bi-weekly during May, July and August and monthly during June",
and September. Samples will be collected and composited from five discrete depths above the,
"pycnocline at seven mesohaline stations (CB3.3C, CB4.3C, CB5.2, WT5.1, ET5.2, LE1.1 and",
LE2.2). Note that this is the same water from which the nano/microplankton samples are taken.,LE2.2). Note that this is the same water from which the nano/microplankton samples are taken.
A 125-ml subsample will be removed and placed in a Nalgene bottle containing 2-ml of,
gluteraldehyde. The labeled sample bottle will be placed in a cooler with ice and transported,
back to the lab for processing. A total of 61 samples will be processed (includes 5 QA/QC,
recounts) during the year.,
