determine the quality of the phytoplankton community as it relates to water quality and as food,

(chlorophyll a) and photosynthetic rate (primary production measured by the 14 C technique).,
The combination of these parameters allows for the assessment of community health of the,
primary producers. This group is extremely important from the standpoint of monitoring water,

Project Description,
The Phytoplankton Component of the Monitoring Program measures phytoplankton,
"species composition abundances, primary productivity and vertical distributions of in vivo",
fluorescence/chlorophyll a at all primary plankton stations and distributions of autotrophic,
picoplankton in the mesohaline portion of the estuary in MD during May-September (Figure 2).,
"In addition, vertical distributions of chlorophyll a are also determined at a series of additional",
stations sampled for water quality by MDDNR in the Patuxent River and Chesapeake Bay.,
Continuous underway measurements of chlorophyll a (horizontal in vivo fluorescence) are also,
made between these MDDNR stations and the primary stations routinely sampled for,
phytoplankton and productivity.,

Data Quality Indicator,Methodologies
Precision,The counting technique which is used (Utermohl technique)
,requires a minimum of 200 individual cells to be counted in 10
,random fields at the primary magnification (312.5X). This
,"number of cells produces a precision of 80%, whereby a"
,recount of a sample should produce a total cell density within
,80% of the original count. Inter-lab recounts are done on 10%
,of the samples and the resulting total density must be within
,80% of the original or the re-count is done again until this
,precision is attained.
Bias,Bias within taxonomist is determined by enumerating the same
,samples by different taxonomists. This is done annually
,between the MD taxonomist (MSUERC) and the VA
,taxonomist (ODU) in a split sample program. The results of
,these split sample efforts are documented in reports.
Accuracy,Accuracy has not been tested for phytoplankton enumerations.
,The reason for this is that there is no way to know the
,absolute composition of phytoplankton in a field sample. It
,has been discussed to mix several algal cultures into one
,sample and have a particle counter provide an estimate of the
,"densities of the various algae, but this has not been carried out."
Representativeness,The phytoplankton samples are collected by compositing the
,same volume of water from five distinct depths in replicate.
,The replicate composites are combined and the sample is
,removed from this replicate composite. This enhances the
,representativeness of the sample and is aimed at reducing the
,effects of ‘patchiness’ inherent in phytoplankton populations.
Comparability,The split sample program between MD and VA is aimed at
,producing a Baywide phytoplankton data set which is
,comparable. Many steps have been taken over the years to
,maximize this comparability between the two phytoplankton
,labs.
Completeness,The MD phytoplankton program has recently added four
,additional sampling sites because of incomplete spatial
,coverage. Only the portion of the water column above the
,pycnocline is analyzed because of funding issues. Temporally
,key months are sampled bi-weekly while other months are not
,sampled – this was done because of knowledge gained about
,phytoplankton population dynamics and a recent power
,analysis supported this decision.
,8
MD PHYTO QAPP,4/15/09
Sensitivity,The enumeration technique employs three different
,magnifications which allows for the detection and optimal
,enumeration of cells of different size and density within a
,sample. A low magnification scan (125X) of the entire
,"chamber provides maximum sensitivity for the rare, larger"
,taxa.
Table 1 (continued):,Data Quality Indicators (DQI) for the MD Phytoplankton
Component of the Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program.,
Parameter: Chlorophyll,
Data Quality Indicator,Methodologies
Precision,The chlorophyll technique is standardized within the lab.
,Blanks are run on the spectrophotometer during each set of
,samples. A split sample program has been established
,whereby replicate samples from the same carboy of Bay water
,are sent to 8 different labs for analysis. The comparison of
,these replicate samples allows for an indication of inter-lab
,precision.
Bias,The split sample program previously mentioned enables
,MSUERC to monitor bias in these results since the program is
,carried out 4 times/year over a twenty-five year period. The
,comparison of MSUERC chlorophyll concentrations to other
,labs’ results enables the detection of bias. With detection of
,"bias, there are a series of steps which are taken to attempt to"
,detect the source of the bias.
Accuracy,Chlorophyll standards (known concentration) are periodically
,used to assess the accuracy of the chlorophyll technique.
Representativeness,On many of the cruises chlorophyll samples are filtered
,relative to in vivo fluorescence readings (a unitless measure of
,chlorophyll). These samples are purposefully taken at as wide
,a range of in vivo fluorescence readings as possible which
,thereby provides representativeness relative to a wide range of
,chlorophyll concentrations.
Comparability,Since the split sample program includes 8 different
,"laboratories, comparability of data is tested routinely as part of"
,this program.
Completeness,Chlorophyll samples are taken in conjunction with a
,continuous flow-through measure of in vivo fluorescence at
,the surface of the water column and at each 1-2 meters
,throughout the water column at many sampling sites
,(mainstem Bay and Patuxent River). The other sampling sites
,9
MD PHYTO QAPP,4/15/09
,produce vertical profiles with in vivo fluorescence measured
,every1-3 meters. This level of sampling produces a
,comprehensive data set for chlorophyll.
Sensitivity,The chlorophyll technique which is used at MSUERC is
,sensitive to ~ 1 ug chl/L. Below that level the detection limit
,is exceeded. This has been determined from standards that
,have been run for a variety of different chlorophyll
,concentrations.
Table 1 (continued):,Data Quality Indicators (DQI) for the MD Phytoplankton
Component of the Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program.,
Parameter: Primary Productivity,
Data Quality Indicator,Methodologies
Precision,Precision for this metric is determined by the
,carbon:chlorophyll (assimilation ratio) for the two composite
,samples which are collected at each sampling site. Since these
,"composites are not replicates, the way to normalize them"
,relative to carbon fixation (primary productivity) is by using
,the chlorophyll concentrations of the two carboys to calculate
,the assimilation ratio.
Bias,A QA/QC split sample comparison was made with ODU’s
,primary productivity lab in 2002. The results of this split
,sample effort indicated a bias between the two labs that was
,partially attributed to differences in protocols in determining
,carbon fixation rates. A report is on file that documents the
,results of this comparison.
Accuracy,It is difficult to assess the accuracy of this measure since there
,is not a standard to test experimental results against.
Representativeness,"The distribution of sample sites, the variety of biomass"
,conditions and the seasonal array of collections contribute to
,"representativeness. In addition, the replication of composite"
,samples in the euphotic zone aids in compensating for patchy
,distributions of phytoplankton.
Comparability,Inter-lab comparability is accomplished from replicate
,samples which are normalized with chlorophyll concentrations
,to provide an assimilation ratio which should be similar
,between the two replicate composites. Intra-lab comparability
,was assessed in 2002 with a split sample analysis with ODU.
Completeness,Primary productivity measures are taken at the highest
,possible frequency and at all of the primary phytoplankton
,stations in the monitoring program.
,10
MD PHYTO QAPP,4/15/09
Sensitivity,The measure of productivity is made with stock solution
,which is very concentrated. This enables sufficient readings
,(disintegrations of the radioisotope) to take place during short
,"incubations, when biomass is low and during times of the year"
,when phytoplankton metabolism is inherently low (winter).

Light attenuation at each of the 14 primary stations will be determined with a LiCor,
quantum sensor and/or secchi disk. The light attenuation of a water column is determined,
directly by measuring photosynthetically available radiation (PAR 400-720 nm) at different,
depths in the water column. A profile is accomplished by measuring PAR at the surface (with,
the sensor just below the surface of the water) and at either 0.25m or 0.50m intervals until,

photosyntheis. This depth can be approximated by the depth at which there is 1% of the surface,photosyntheis. This depth can be approximated by the depth at which there is 1% of the surface
radiation. It is used in extrapolating a photosynthetic rate for a particular water column or,
