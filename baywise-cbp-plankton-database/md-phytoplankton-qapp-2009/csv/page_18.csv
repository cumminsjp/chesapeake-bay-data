mgC/ m3 / h = [(dpm1 - dpm0) * 1.05 * CA] / ( Rs/t1),
where: dpm1= dpm of replicate 1 sub-sample,
dpm0= dpm of time zero sub-sample,
V= volume of sub-sample filtered,
CA= carbonate alkalinity in mgC/m3,
Rs= total C14 dpm in 100 ml sample,
t1= incubation time (hrs) for replicate 1 sub-sample,
Chlorophyll-normalized rates will be determined from the ratio of the carbon fixation rate and,
chlorophyll a concentration from each composite sample.,
Routine wipe tests are conducted in order to assess radiation levels in the laboratories,
where isotopes are used. The results of these tests are stored in a wipe log maintained by the,
radiation safety officer. The liquid waste generated from the 14 C technique is neutralized by,
acidification and disposed of down the drain. The solid waste is stored on site at MSUERC until,acidification and disposed of down the drain. The solid waste is stored on site at MSUERC until
a sufficient quantity is generated whereupon it is removed and disposed of by a radiation safety,a sufficient quantity is generated whereupon it is removed and disposed of by a radiation safety

"Until 2005, the sample is initially enumerated at 500X using a random fields technique",
"(Venrick, 1978). A minimum of twenty random fields and 200 individual cells are enumerated.","(Venrick, 1978). A minimum of twenty random fields and 200 individual cells are enumerated."
Additional fields are counted until the minimum count is attained. When there are a large,
"number of cells of a particular taxon in a sample, fewer than twenty random fields are",
enumerated with a minimum of 5 random fields examined for this taxon. Individual cells are,
"enumerated, whether in chains, filaments or colonies.",This allows for a more accurate estimate
of biomass which is determined from the cell densities. Upon achieving twenty random fields,
