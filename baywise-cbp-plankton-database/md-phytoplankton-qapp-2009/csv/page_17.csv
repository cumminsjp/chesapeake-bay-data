supernatant/sample is carefully poured off into a plastic 25 ml graduated cylinder. The volume,supernatant/sample is carefully poured off into a plastic 25 ml graduated cylinder. The volume
of the sample is measured and recorded in the data book. The sample is poured into a 1 cm,
spectrophotometric cuvette (3-4 mls generally). The cuvette is wiped off carefully with a,
Kimwipe and placed in the spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometer has a moving rack that,
"holds 5 cuvettes, 4 are samples and 1 is a blank (filled with 90% acetone). The",
spectrophotometer is zeroed with the blank at 750nm. Each sample is read at this wavelength,
and the value is recorded in the data book. The spectrophotometer is then changed to a,
wavelength of 665nm and the above process is repeated. After the initial reading at 665nm is,
"recorded, 3 drops of 2N HCl is added to each sample. The samples are then read again at 665nm","recorded, 3 drops of 2N HCl is added to each sample. The samples are then read again at 665nm"

cuvette is rinsed with 90% acetone 3 times before being filled again.,
All values that have been recorded in the data book are entered into a spreadsheet that,
contains the equation for calculating chlorophyll concentration. The equation used is from,
"Standard Methods: Chl, ug/l = 26.73 (665b-665a) x V1 / V2, where, 665b and 665a are the",
"optical densities of the 90% acetone extract before and after acidification, V1 is the volume of",
the extract and V2 is the sample volume that was filtered.,
