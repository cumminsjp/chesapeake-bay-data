The samples are transported back to the lab at the end of the cruise in a cooler of ice.,

Primary Productivity and Light Attenuation,
Photosynthetic rates in phytoplankton assemblages are measured at 14 stations (the,
thirteen plankton stations and CB1.1) by using 14 C-techniques outlined in Strickland and Parsons,thirteen plankton stations and CB1.1) by using 14 C-techniques outlined in Strickland and Parsons
"(1972). During the course of a year, 555 samples are processed for primary production. The",
samples for primary production are taken from the replicate surface composite carboys (15-l),
which have been previously subsampled for the phytoplankton species composition samples.,
There is a period of 0.5-6 h between the time that the samples are collected and when they are,
"processed. On the Patuxent River and mainstem Chesapeake Bay cruises, the carboys are kept in","processed. On the Patuxent River and mainstem Chesapeake Bay cruises, the carboys are kept in"

carboys are kept in the shade at ambient air temperatures until being processed.,
Light attenuation at each of the 14 primary stations will be determined with a LiCor,
quantum sensor and/or secchi disk. The light attenuation of a water column is determined,
directly by measuring photosynthetically available radiation (PAR 400-720 nm) at different,
depths in the water column. A profile is accomplished by measuring PAR at the surface (with,
the sensor just below the surface of the water) and at either 0.25m or 0.50m intervals until,
achieving a value 10% of the surface reading. Simultaneous deck cell readings are recorded for,achieving a value 10% of the surface reading. Simultaneous deck cell readings are recorded for
each reading at depth. The important depth in regards to photosynthesis by phytoplankton is the,each reading at depth. The important depth in regards to photosynthesis by phytoplankton is the
compensation depth. This is the depth at which respiration is equivalent to the level of gross,
photosyntheis. This depth can be approximated by the depth at which there is 1% of the surface,photosyntheis. This depth can be approximated by the depth at which there is 1% of the surface
radiation. It is used in extrapolating a photosynthetic rate for a particular water column or,
sampling site.,
Phytoplankton Species Composition,

"are collected using a small diaphragm pump and hose. Once collected, 500-ml subsamples from","are collected using a small diaphragm pump and hose. Once collected, 500-ml subsamples from"

At primary stations typified by shallow depths and/or generally homogeneous water columns,

sample from the entire water column (30-l from ten discrete depths) will be subsampled for,

"ET5.2, WT5.1, WT6.1 and WT8.1) phytoplankton will be enumerated and identified in a",
