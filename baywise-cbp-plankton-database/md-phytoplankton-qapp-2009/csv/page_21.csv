"Instrument/Equipment Testing, Inspection, Maintenance and Calibration",
Microscopes and light meters are inspected and maintained on an annual basis.,

The performance of the spectrophotometer used in chlorophyll a analysis is tested,
indirectly during the QA tests run on the chlorophyll protocol. If there is discrepancy in,
"chlorophyll concentrations during inter or intralab QA efforts, the instrument is one of the",
variables which is tested for causing the discrepancy. The interlab QA test for chlorophyll a,
involves use of a chlorophyll standard which acts as a test of the accuracy of the,
spectrophotometer.,
The fluorometers (3) are tested against one another annually and calibrated to give,
readings which are within 10% of one another. The in vivo fluorescence data which is converted,readings which are within 10% of one another. The in vivo fluorescence data which is converted
