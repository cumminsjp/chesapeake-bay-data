data managers is a prescribed EPA data format that contains all of the necessary header,

Assessments and Response Actions,
The chlorophyll a and phytoplankton taxonomy components of the Phytoplankton,
Monitoring Program have regular QA assessments. The chlorophyll a component is part of a,
blind audit program which takes place quarterly. This audit is conducted by the EPA-CBP,
Analytical Methods and Quality Assurance Workgroup. This audit includes results from eight,
different laboratories. A summary report is produced with the results for each blind audit and,
this report is distributed amongst the various participants. The phytoplankton taxonomy,
component utilizes a split sample assessment in conjunction with the VA Phytoplankton,
Monitoring Program under the auspices of the EPA-CBP Quality Assurance Officer. This split,Monitoring Program under the auspices of the EPA-CBP Quality Assurance Officer. This split
sample assessment is conducted annually and the focus and design change from year to year.,
The results of this assessment are presented at a meeting of the two phytoplankton laboratories,
