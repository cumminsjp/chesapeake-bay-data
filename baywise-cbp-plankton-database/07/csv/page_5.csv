The following equation is used to convert raw counts to density for each taxon identified:,The following equation is used to convert raw counts to density for each taxon identified:,
,DENSITY = A * (B/(C * FVOL_M3)),
Where DENSITY = density in numbers per cubic meter,Where DENSITY = density in numbers per cubic meter,
,A = number of individuals counted in the sub sample,
,B = volume in milliliters of sample from which sub samples are taken,
,C = sub sample volume in milliliters,
,FVOL_M3 = volume of water filtered by the bongo nets in cubic meters,
