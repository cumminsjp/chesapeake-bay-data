the site selection approach.,
Random:,A random or random-stratified design was applied to select the site for its
,first sampling (this can include sites that are resampled in subsequent
,years)
Random-reference:,A random or random-stratified design was applied to select the site for
,its first sampling; it was subsequently identified as a reference site
Targeted-baseline:,Tthe site is considered representative of some landscape feature and
,was selected for long-term monitoring purposes in a non-random fashion
,"(includes sites established upstream of a known, suspected, or pending"
,impairment)
Targeted-reference:,The site was selected for its first sampling because it was known or
,suspected of being reference quality
Targeted-systematic:,"A systematic (grid, stream node, etc) sampling design was applied to"
,select the site for its first sampling
