TITLE: Primary Production
PARAMETER NAME (NEW): CARBONFIX
UNITS OF MEASURE: Microgram Carbon Per Liter Per Hour
"METHOD CODES: PD101, PD 102"
GENERAL INFORMATION:
"It was determined that the Maryland and Virginia primary production measurements, should be analyzed"
separately due shipboard methodology differences. The historic Maryland protocol collected 15 liter
samples and held the productivity samples at near-ambient temperatures and shipboard light conditions
for 0.5 - 6 hours. Thus samples were able to begin acclimating to relatively high light levels on shipboard
and samples may have experience above-ambient temperatures before they were placed in light-
"saturated, temperature-controlled incubation chambers in the laboratory. The historic Virginia protocol"
collected 1 liter samples and maintained productivity samples in a closed cooler on ice prior to being sent
to the laboratory for analysis. Virginia’s samples experienced below-ambient temperatures in all seasons
"but winter, and were acclimated to low light when they were placed in the incubation chambers. The end"
result of these protocol differences is that Maryland primary production rates appear to be consistently
different (greater) than Virginia rates.

"At each station water column structure was assessed, water was pumped from five discrete depths above"
the pycnocline (or top half of the water column if a pycnocline is not evident) and composited in a 20-
gallon carboy on shipboard. Two composite samples were collected at each station. Carboys were held in
"varying conditions, for 6 hours, depending on station, but procedures were consistent for each"
station. Pre-incubation history can be classified into four groups:
Group A - Samples immediately put in a shipboard incubator chamber.
"TF1.5 - Patuxent River, tidal fresh"
"CB1.1 - mouth of the Susquehanna River, tidal fresh"
"CB2.2 - upper Bay mainstem, oligohaline (After February 2000)"
"CB3.3 - middle Bay mainstem, mesohaline"
"CB4.3 - middle Bay mainstem, mesohaline (After to February 2000)"
"WT5.1 - Baltimore Harbor, mesohaline"
"Group B - Unprotected samples which were taken immediately to shore, and transported"
between 1 - 2 hours in a van to the laboratory where they were placed immediately in the
laboratory incubator. Air temperature in the van was somewhat warmer than ambient in winter.
"The van was not air conditioned in summer prior to 2005, and summer samples may have"
"experience very warm temperatures. The samples also experience extremes in light conditions,"
from direct sunlight on shipboard to the interior darkness of a van.
"TF2.3 (~ 2 h) - upper Potomac River, tidal fresh"
"LE2.2 (~1 h) - lower Potomac River, mesohaline"
"CB5.2 (~1 h) - middle Bay, mesohaline"
"Group C - Samples were kept on shipboard in an unshaded, ambient temperature water bath"
"anywhere between 1 and 5.5 hours, then put in a shipboard incubator."
"CB2.2 – (~?) upper Bay mainstem, oligohaline (Prior to February 2000)"
"TF1.7 (~1 h) - middle Patuxent River, oligohaline"
"LE1.1 (~2.5 h) - lower Patuxent River, mesohaline"
"CB4.3 (~5.5 h) - middle Bay mainstem, mesohaline (Prior to February 2000)"
Group D - Samples were held unprotected on shipboard & van (~ 5 hours) or in the van (~3-4
"hours), then placed in the incubator. Samples experience temperature conditions that differ from"
"the ambient, i.e. typically colder in winter and hotter in summer. The van was heated in winter but"
