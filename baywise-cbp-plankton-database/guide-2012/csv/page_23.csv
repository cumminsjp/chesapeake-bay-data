BIOLOGICAL DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE ISSUES
The goal of quality assurance is to provide the user with data of known high quality. The first stage of
"quality assurance is quality control (QC), which is performed by personnel in the field and laboratory to"
ensure that data meet quality standards. Quality assurance assessments for all data analyses measure
"two quantities, precision and accuracy. Precision is the repeatability of measurements, and accuracy is"
"the closeness of analytical measurements to a ""true"" value. In the case of biological data, enumeration"
accuracy is often method and personnel dependant. Although the accuracy of taxonomic identifications
"can only truly tested through cost prohibitive genetic analysis, accuracy is approximated well by"
consultation with taxonomic experts and the use of voucher collections.
Intra-organization QAQC
"Among the CBP biological programs, participating data providers have internal quality assurance/quality"
"control programs. To assess within-organization precision and accuracy, most programs standard"
protocolise randomly selected and re-enumerated approximately 5-10% samples for quality assurance.
"The QA sample assess,emt must have a total density and dominant taxa densities within 10% of the"
"original count. For CBPO funded or match programs, quality assurance recount data are submitted to"
CBP separately from the rest of the long term monitoring data and are maintained in an offline data base.
The QA recount data are available upon request.
Inter-organization QAQC
Inter-organization precision and accuracy assessments have been problematic in the biological
monitoring programs. The tidal benthic monitoring programs established and continue to maintain an
informal quality assurance program between participating labs during the early phases of the program.
"However, a program of regular quality assurance /quality control and split-sample comparisons between"
laboratories was not part of either the phytoplankton or zooplankton long-term monitoring programs prior
to 1998. From 1998 through 2008 a split-sampling program was conducted to compare results of the
"Maryland and Virginia mesozooplankton, microzooplankton and phytoplankton long-term monitoring"
programs. The non-tidal benthic monitoring programs currently have no mechanism for assessing
precision and accuracy between data providers.
