Maryland,
•,July 1984-June 1988. No random sampling was conducted.
•,July 1989-June 1994. A small area random strata sampling element was added around 27
,existing fixed site. Additionally four new strata were added in regions where sampling was
,"previously absent, but were targeted for resource management activity. Samples were collected"
,at random from approximately 25 kilometer 2 area surrounding fixed sites to assess the
,representatives-ness of the fixed locations. Stratum boundaries were determined by
,"environmental factors, which impact benthic community compositions in the bay including salinity,"
,"sediment type, and bottom depth. Each area was visited on four to six sampling cruises annually"
,and single benthic samples were collected from the fixed and three random sties in each small
,area.
•,"July 1994-June 1995. The habitat strata were redefined in 1994 using EMAP criteria to ""piggy-"
,"back"" on EMAP sampling results. Three sampling strata were defined, the mainstem (including"
,"Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds, the Potomac River and remaining tributaries. Twenty-seven"
,"samples were allocated to the mainstem, twenty-eight to the Potomac River and eleven to the"
,other tributaries in Maryland.
•,July 1995-Present. The habitat strata were redefined again in 1995 to better suit the state of
,"Maryland information needs. Six strata were defined, the Potomac River, the Patuxnet River, the"
,"upper Maryland Bay (all Chesapeake Bay Mainstem above/north the Bay Bridge), the Lower"
,"Maryland Bay (all Chesapeake Bay Mainstem below/South of the Bay Bridge), the Eastern"
,"Tributaries (all tributaries to Chesapeake Bay on the Eastern shore), and the Western Tributaries"
,"(all tributaries to Chesapeake Bay on the Western shore, excluding the Potomac and Patuxnet"
,Rivers). Twenty-five samples were allotted to each stratum. Regions on the Maryland Main stem
,deeper that 12 meters are excluded from sampling because the area has been consistently found
,to be azoic.
Virginia,
•,January 1985-December 1995. No random sampling was conducted.
•,January 1996-Present. A probability-based sampling component was added in coordination with
,the random strata-sampling program in Maryland waters. Twenty-five stations were randomly
,"selected in each of five strata, the Elizabeth, the James River, the York River, the Rappahannock"
,River and the mainstem of Chesapeake Bay. In each stratum five additional sites were randomly
,selected as potential replacement sites for any station rejected in the field due to an inability to
,"sample the site (e.g. an oyster reef, or inter-tidal site). Random stations were sampled between"
,July 15 and September 31 of each year.
