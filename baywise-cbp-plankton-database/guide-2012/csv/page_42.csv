GENERAL INFORMATION:
After a series of quality assurance inquiries it has been determined that the horizontal and vertical
fluorescence monitoring data has a variety of quality issues that users need to be aware of. Data quality
issues include positional accuracy of horizontal fluorescence data collected prior to 2000 and calibration
issues in the Maryland data associated with the regression curves used to covert fluorescence voltages to
chlorophyll a values.
Sampling Site Position Determination Issues
The Maryland horizontal fluorescence data collected by Morgan State University between 1984 and April
1999 (excluding the special Potomac survey) and all Virginia horizontal fluorescence collected by Old
Dominion University between 1991 and 1997 had station latitudes and longitudes estimated through an
interpolation process. The latitudes and longitudes are at best approximations of actual positions in the
field. Inaccuracies in the estimated station locations may be problematic in mapping or ground truthing
applications.
"For purposes of determining the actual geographical location of a reading, sampling station location along"
transects was determined using the simple geometry of right triangles to compute latitude and longitude.
Calculations were based on the following assumptions: a) the transect was over a straight line from
"departure station to arrival station, b) boat speed was assumed to be constant, c) the Latitudes and"
Longitudes of end point stations were fixed points. Equations were based on the relationship of total strip
recorder tape length being proportional to actual distance between stations. Sampling position was based
on the distance from the starting position of the strip recorder tape of the at-sample time against the total
length of the tape at the destination station.
Also note that all horizontal and vertical fluorescence with direct position reporting by LORAN-C collected
in Virginia from 1991-1995 and Maryland from 1984-1999 does not meet current EPA sampling position
policy. The current EPA sampling position policy requires that position be measured with a Global
Positioning System (GPS). However locations determined with Loran-C and should be less problematic
in mapping or ground truthing applications and reasonable approximations of actual location.
Fluorescence Value Calculation Issues
"As part of a remote sensing ground truthing exercise in 1998, comparison of interpolated Maryland"
horizontal fluorescence and water quality surface chlorophyll a data was made. Comparisons revealed
that the existing fluorescence chlorophyll a values were “orders of magnitude lower than corresponding
water quality values”. These differences were not present in the corresponding Virginia data. While in-situ
"fluorescence values are generally accepted to be depressed measurements of chlorophyll, the magnitude"
of the differences warranted further investigation.
A comparison both the Maryland and Virginia sampling protocols revealed two significant issues affecting
data values. Although both programs used periodic grab samples to create a regression to convert
"instrument voltage to chlorophyll a values, the regressions were calculated differently. Both Virginia"
laboratories were doing daily regression curves wile Maryland computed a single curve based on all 3
days of a sampling cruise. Additionally the Maryland laboratory analysis method for grab chlorophyll
samples was determined to be significantly different from the standard CBP water quality chlorophyll
