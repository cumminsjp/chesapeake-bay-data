protocol. Several changes were made to the Maryland program to remedy these issues. All fluorescence
"data collected by both states after 1998 was reported with its corresponding instrument voltages, to allow"

computing daily regressions for fluorescence and adopted the standard CBP water quality method for
analysis of grab chlorophyll samples in 2000.
