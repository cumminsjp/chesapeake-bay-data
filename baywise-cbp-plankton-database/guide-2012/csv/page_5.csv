This document describes how to access biological monitoring data from the Chesapeake Bay Program's,This document describes how to access biological monitoring data from the Chesapeake Bay Program's
Chesapeake Data Enterprise (CDE) formerly the Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS).,Chesapeake Data Enterprise (CDE) formerly the Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS).
It provides information on:,
•,Currently available Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) biological monitoring and geographic
,information system (GIS) databases;
•,"Procedures for obtaining biological monitoring data online from the CBP- Bay Resource Library,"
,"online from other program partner web sitess, or directly from the Living Resources Data Manager"
,and/or Living Resources GIS specialists;
•,"CIMS/CDE standards for publishing data to the public, including field names, attributes, and data"
,dictionary tables;
•,Guidance for organizations submitting biological data directly to the CBPO data center;
•,Guidance for data usage and ecosystem indicator metrics.
"Tidal Phytoplankton, Zooplankton and Benthos","Tidal Phytoplankton, Zooplankton and Benthos"
,"All Chesapeake Bay phytoplankton, historic zooplankton (including microzooplankton,"
,mesozooplankton and gelatinous zooplankton) and benthos monitoring data and data
,documentation for Maryland and Virginia from 1984 to present can be obtained directly from the
,Internet web site (http://www.chesapeakebay.net) or from the Living Resources Data Manager. In
,addition to monitoring data there are a variety of calculated biological metrics and indexes of
,biotic integrity data are also available. All data are published in standardized formats and are
,compatible with the CBP water quality and other databases. They are available online a) comma
,or tab delimited ASCII flat files or XML Schema formatted files. Other formats are available upon
,request.
Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV),
,Data and documentation for the annual Chesapeake Bay Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Aerial
,Survey are generated and managed by the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS). Data is
,maintained as GIS data layers. Survey data layers and related reports are available from the
,VIMS SAV web site (http://www.vims.edu/bio/sav/index.html). These data are also accessible
,"through a variety of Internet based mapping tools, including Chesapeake Stat"
,(http://stat.chesapeakebay.net/) on the CBP web site.
Non-Tidal Benthic Macroinvertebrates,
,The Chesapeake Bay Program Office (CBPO) has acquired historical and current benthic
,"macroinvertebrate, habitat, and water quality data for non-tidal streams and wadeable rivers from"
,"over 20 federal, state, regional, local, and academic monitoring programs throughout the"
,"Chesapeake Bay basin. Data from 1992-2010 have been obtained from the data providers,"
,"reprocessed, and quality checked and assured. The data are used to compute the annual"
,Chessie B-IBI that serves as an indicator of local stream health for the watershed. Most data
,"originators are allowing their raw monitoring data, as well as the biological metrics and Chessie"
,B-IBI calculated by the Living Resources Data Manager to be distributed by the Bay Program
,Data Center. All data are published in standardized formats and are compatible with the CBP
,water quality and other databases. They are available online a) comma or tab delimited ASCII
,flat files or XML Schema formatted files from the internet web site
,(http://www.chesapeakebay.net) or from the Living Resources Data Manager. Other formats are
,available upon request.
