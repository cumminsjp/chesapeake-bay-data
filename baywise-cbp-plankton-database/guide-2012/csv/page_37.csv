TITLE: Mesozooplankton Counts
PARAMETER NAME (NEW): COUNTS
UNITS OF MEASURE: Number per liter
"METHOD CODES: MZ101A, MZ101B. MZ101C, MZ102, MZ103"
GENERAL INFORMATION:
"After extensive examination of historic mesozooplankton monitoring data, and in consideration of the"
"known methodological and data quality issues, the CBP is issuing the following data usage"
recommendation: Only mesozooplankton samples enumerated with Hensen-Stempel (HS) methodologies
"are recommended for use in quantitative analyses. These data have method codes MZ101A, MZ101B,"
"MZ101C, and MZ103. Data quality issues have been identified for portions of the Virginia record."
"Virginia samples collected prior to 1993 and enumerated with method MZ102, as well as those samples"
"collected between 1993 and 2000 and enumerated with method MZ102 or MZ102B, should only be used"
for qualitative purposes (Johnson 2007).Baywide sampling for mesozooplankton ended in September
2002 due to the termination of the CBP zooplankton monitoring program in October 2002.

"Mesozooplankton were collected in the field, with stepped oblique bongo net tows at each station. Bongo"
nets were deployed 0.5 meters above the bottom and nets were raised in 1-4 meter increments (usually
0.5 to 1.5 minutes/step) depending on station depth with a minimum of 5 steps per station. In the
"laboratory, samples were enumerated using a standard sub-sampling technique with a Hensen-Stempel"
pipette (HS) (Harris et.al. 2000). A hierarchical counting technique was employed to obtain density
estimates. This procedure consists of first counting at least 60 individuals of the most dominant forms
"(e.g. Acartia tonsa) in a small sub sample (usually 1 - 2 milliliters), followed by 5- and 10- milliliter sub"
samples from which all species that had counts less than 60 in the previous sub sample were counted.
The basic technique was modified slightly three times over the 18 year history of the program. The
"standard HS count and a whole sample scan for macrozooplankton (amphipods, shrimp, fish eggs, fish"
"larvae and juvenile fish, etc.) was performed on each sample between 1984 and 1989. The"
macrozooplankton sample scan was temporarily discontinued from 1990 to 1996 (MZ101B). In 1996 the
macro-zooplankton scan was reinstated and large bodied mesozooplankton species occurring in small
numbers in the initial count were enumerated in special 850-micron sieve counts were again reported
(MZ101C). Note that after 1 January 1999 smaller species occurring in small numbers in the standard
count but occurred predominantly in the special 850-micron sieve counts were reported only in the
method MZ 101C count.

"-Chesapeake Bay Program Analytical Method Code-MZ102, MZ102B"
Field samples were collected by taking five minute double-oblique pattern bongo net tows from bottom to
"surface. From1985 to 1992, the bongo nets used for field sampling were not equipped with flow meters to"
accurately estimate the volume of water filtered through the nets during a tow. The volume of water
"filtered during a tow was estimated using the length of the tow and area of the net’s opening. In 1993, a"
flow meter were mounted on the nets. From 1985 through 1997 a Controlled Variability Sampling (CVS)
method (method MZ102) described by Alden et.al. 1982 was used for sample enumeration. The CVS
"technique used a connected series of five wet sieves (200, 300, 600, 850, and 2000 microns) and a"
mechanized shaking apparatus to separate and zooplankton were then counted by size fraction. Size
classes in which the organisms were too numerous to count in their entirety were split with a Folsom
plankton splitter until an appropriate sample size is reached for statistically valid counts of the dominant
species. The chosen error level of 35% required that each species of interest be counted to achieve a
