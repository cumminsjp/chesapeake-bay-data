TITLE: Picoplankton Counts
PARAMETER NAME (NEW): COUNTS
UNITS OF MEASURE: Number of Cells per liter
"METHOD CODES: PP101, PP102"
GENERAL INFORMATION:
The 2008 phytoplankton split sample program examined the comparability of picoplankton counts
between program participants. The resulting split sample analysis showed high agreement (±5%
"difference) between laboratory counts. This suggest that despite the known differences in microscopes,"
"filter cubes and internal laboratory procedures, if like volumes of sample are enumerated good precision"
between the labs can be obtained.

"When brought to the phytoplankton laboratory, samples (125 ml) will be stored in a refrigerator at 4 oC and"
the counting procedures will be completed within 7-14 days after their collection date. Using a millipore
"apparatus, a backing 0.45 um nuclepore filter, wetted with distilled water, is placed on the millipore stem."
"Then a blackened 0.20 um nuclepore filter, is placed over the other filter. 1-2 ml of the shaken water"
"sample is added to the filter apparatus. Using a pump, and a maximum vacuum pressure of 10 cm OF Hg"
"(13.3 kPa), the sample is filtered until the meniscus disappears from the top filter. The 0.2 um nuclepore"
filter is removed and placed immediately on a glass slide previously moistened with breath. A drop of
"immersion oil (Cargille type A, refractive index 1.515) is placed at the center of the filter, and then a cover"
"glass is added, followed by another drop of immersion oil to the cover glass. The slide is examined"
immediately with an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100-W Hg lamp and a 100X oil
immersion objective (Neofluar 100/1.30) at 1000X magnification. Using an appropriate filter set random
"field counts are made on both replicate samples, and averaged. A minimum coverage of 20 fields is the"
procedure followed for each slide. Cells not counted here are those previously identified and counted with
the phytoplankton sample at 300x or 600X (e.g. some Merismopedia spp.).
Maryland Enumeration protocol from 2002-Present
-Chesapeake Bay Program Analytical Method Code PP102
The field samples are returned to the lab and held in a refrigerator (4 0C) until processing begins (≤ 7
"days). Using a 25-mm Millipore filtration apparatus, a 0.45 μm backing filter is placed on the filter holder"
and moistened with distilled water. A 0.2 μm Irgalan black-stained nucleopore filter is placed on top of the
backing filter and the filter chimney attached to the base. An appropriate volume of sample water
(generally 1-2 ml) is placed in the chimney and filtered at a low vacuum pressure (~ 5 kPa). The
nucleopore filter is removed from the base and placed in the center of a glass microscope slide. A drop of
"immersion oil (Cargille type A) is placed in the middle of the filter, a cover slip placed on top and another"
drop of immersion oil added on top of the cover slip. The slide is gently tamped with a paper towel and
either examined immediately or placed in a slide box in a freezer until microscopic inspection occurs. The
glass slide holding the sample filter is placed on a Leitz Laborlux compound microscope outfitted with a
50-W mercury bulb and inspected at a magnification of 1250X. The autofluorescence characteristics of
the phototrophic picoplankton cells are detected by using two different filter sets - one with an excitation
wavelength of 450-490 nm which excites the chlorophyll a and type I phycoerythrins (common to the
"dominant group of picoplankton - cyanobacteria), the other a yellow-green wavelength of 520-560 nm"
which illuminates the type II phycoerythrins and the phycocyanins. A minimum of 200 cells and 20
random fields are counted.
