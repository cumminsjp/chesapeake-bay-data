•,"July 1984- June 1988. Samples were collected from seventy fixed sites, on eight to ten occasions"
,annually. Numbers ranging from 001 to 080 identifies the fixed stations. During each sampling
,"event three samples were taken at each site, with varying types of gear."
•,July 1989-June 1994. Fixed site sampling continued at 27 sites located within the small strata
,random sampling areas. Each area was visited on four to six sampling cruises annually and
,single benthic samples were collected from the fixed sites in each small area with varying types of
,gear.
•,July 1994-Present. Samples were collected from 27 fixed sites. Twenty-three of these fixed sites
,have been sampled from beginning of program in 1984; they were among the 70 original fixed
,sites sampled from 1884-1989. Two of the other four were additional sites were added in 1989
,and the last two were added in 1995. Three samples are collected at each site during a sampling
,trip with varying types of gear.
