not air conditioned in summer prior to 2005. The samples also experienced extremes in light
"conditions, from direct sunlight on shipboard to the interior darkness of a van."
"ET5.1 (~ 3 h) - upper Choptank, oligohaline"
"ET5.2 (~ 4 h) - lower Choptank, mesohaline"
"RET2.2 (~ 5 h) - middle Potomac River, oligohaline"
"Productivity incubation were performed either on shipboard, on a dock, or immediately upon returning to"
the laboratory. Four 100 ml subsamples per station were decanted from the two surface-layer composite
"samples into sample-rinsed Pyrex milk dilution bottles (or polycarbonate bottles after July, 1989). One"
"was used for a time-zero C14 blank (t 0), one for an alkalinity determination, and one from each composite"
for C 14 incubation. The incubation samples were placed in a constant light incubator (>250 μE m-2 sec -1)
"receiving running water maintained at ambient temperature for an acclimation period of more than 0.5 h,"
"and usually about 1 h. A 1-ml inoculate of 1-2 μCi labeled NaHCO 3 was added to each sample, and the"
"samples were returned to the incubator for >1 h. After incubation, 15 ml was filtered through a 0.45 μm"
"Millipore membrane filter, rinsed with filtered sample water, and fumed over concentrated HCl. Fifteen ml"
"of the t0 sample was similarly filtered and fumed, immediately following the addition of the radioisotope."
The filters were placed in scintillation vials and stored in a freezer. Scintillation cocktail (Aquasol from
August 1984 to October 1994; Cytoscint from October 1994 to present) was added to the scintillation vials
and the samples were run on a Packard Tri-Carb 2500TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer equipped with
internal quench standards and serviced once a year by the Packard technician. Field stock solutions of
radio-labeled NaHCO 3 were obtained from mixing portions of 25 mCi C 14 NaCO 3 stock solutions with pH
"of 10-10.2 de-ionized water. Final field stock activities approximate 2 μCi C 14 per ml, determined from"
liquid scintillation counting of field stocks in phenethylamine and Biofluor. Field stock activities for each
dilution are then recorded in a laboratory log and were assigned a date interval corresponding to the
period that the field stock is employed in the program.
Virginia Sample Analysis Protocol from 1998-2009

"At each station water column structure was assessed, then water was pumped from five discrete depths"
above the pycnocline (or from top half of water column if pycnocline is absent) and composited in a
carboy. Two composite samples were collected at each station. Two 1-liter water samples were obtained
from each of the two carboys (total of 4 per station) and placed in an iced cooler until their return to the
laboratory. The Virginia protocol held all its samples for 6 hours on shipboard. Productivity
incubation were performed immediately upon returning to the laboratory. Two 100 ml subsamples were
obtained from each station’s two 1-liter composite samples (four from each station). One was used for an
"alkalinity determination, one was used for a time-zero C 14 blank (t0) after acclimation, and one from each"
composite was used for the C 14 incubation. Samples were placed in a water bath equipped with a bottle
holder which rotated between banks of cool-white fluorescent lights. The light levels exceed the light
saturation point of the phytoplankton. Temperature of the water bath was the same as the temperature at
"each station when the samples were taken. After one hour of acclimation, the bottles were inoculated with"
2-5 Ci C 14 NaHCO 3. One of the samples was analyzed for C 14 activity immediately (time 0 sample). Two
samples were returned to the water bath for approximately one hour. All inoculated samples were filtered
"through a 25 mm 0.45 pore-size Millipore filter under a vacuum pressure 
    "
Millipore filters were fumed over concentrated HCl for 30 seconds and placed in scintillation vials.
Scintillation fluid was added to each vial and C 14 activity was determined using a Beckman Model LS
1701 scintillation counter. The amount of C 14 in the stock bottle was determined by placing 20-50 μl of
stock solution in scintillation vials containing 0.5 ml phenethylamine. Scintillation fluid was added to the
"vials, set in the dark overnight, and analyzed for C 14 activity."
