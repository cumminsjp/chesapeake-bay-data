THE 2012 USER'S GUIDE TO CHESAPEAKE BAY
PROGRAM BIOLOGICAL MONITORING DATA
INTRODUCTION
The 2012 User's Guide is intended to help data user’s access and use biological monitoring data
collected in as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program monitoring network. This guide describes many of
the biological databases currently available through the Chesapeake Data Enterprise (CDE) formerly the
Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS) in standardized structures and formats
(CIMS/CDE databases). It describes where the data and data products reside and how to obtain them.
Background
CHESAPEAKE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In 1996 the Chesapeake Executive Council adopted the Strategy for Increasing Basin-wide Public Access
to Chesapeake Bay Information. This strategy called for partners in the Chesapeake Bay Program to
develop and implement the Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS). The intent of CIMS
was to electronically link a variety of information about the Bay and its tributaries and make this
information available electronically through the Internet to a variety of audiences. The information
"targeted for distribution through CIMS included technical and public information, educational material,"
"environmental indicators, policy documents and scientific data."
"As a result of the CIMS initiative the various federal, state, academic and non-governmental organizations"
worked to establish a system of distributed databases. Many of the data assets available through CIMS
were hosted on the data originator’s Internet sites. The intent of the CIMS system was to provide a single
location from which all data assets would be available.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 13508
"On May 12, 2009, President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order that recognizes the Chesapeake"
Bay as a national treasure and calls on the federal government to lead a renewed effort to restore and
protect the nation’s largest estuary and its watershed.
The Executive Order directs CBP partners to “identify the mechanisms that will assure that governmental
"and other activities, including data collection and distribution, are coordinated and effective, relying on"
existing mechanisms where appropriate”.
"In 2010, in response to the Executive Order, the partnership began development of the Chesapeake Data"
Enterprise (CDE) based on the CIMS foundation. The data enterprise shares many of the same principles
"of CIMS, but broadens the partnership to include new data exchange partners and new data themes."
"Additionally, the data enterprise effort seeks to upgrade data exchange methods, adopt new standards,"
and refresh partnership agreements based on newer technologies and approaches.
