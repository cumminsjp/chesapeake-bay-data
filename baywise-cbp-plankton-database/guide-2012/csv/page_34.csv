Maryland Enumeration protocols from 1984-2009
-Chesapeake Bay Program Laboratory Method Code MI101
Protocol for the enumeration of net collected microzooplankton samples. Samples were collected in
the field by pumpling a known quantity of water through a 44 μm mesh net. All samples collected in 44 μm
mesh nets are decanted into a jar containing buffered formaldehyde (final concentration of 2%) and
transferred to the laboratory. Samples were gently mixed and a 1-milliliter aliquot is removed with a
Stempel pipette and put into a Sedgewick-Rafter cell for enumeration with a compound microscope at
"100X magnification. Beginning with samples collected in April 1986, a small drop of concentrated Rose"
Bengal stain was added to the cell prior to addition of the sub sample. The sub sample was allowed to set
for 10 minutes before counting. At least one chamber (1 milliliter) was counted for each sample and if the
"total count did not reach 250 organisms, subsequent 1 milliliter aliquots were enumerated until a count of"
250 or more organisms was obtained or 3 milliliter was examined. If a certain organism was abundant
"(more than 60 per chamber), it was not counted in the subsequent 1 milliliter aliquot for a given sample."
"For extremely abundant taxa, less than one milliliter could be counted. Species identification were made"
using the NODC species code. Microzooplankton smaller than 44 micrometers were noted on the original
data sheet but not enumerated since estimates would not have been quantitative.
-Chesapeake Bay Program Laboratory Method Code MI103
Protocol for the enumeration of whole water collected microzooplankton samples. Samples are
decanted from the replicate carboys of water collected at five discrete depths above the pycnocline. The
whole water microzooplankton samples are preserved with acid Lugol’s solution to a final concentration of
"2 %. In the lab, 5-25 ml are subsampled from the sample jar for settling. This amount depends on how"
"much detritus and plankton were in the sample. If 25 ml was used, the bottle was shaken gently (slowly"
inverted 5 times) and 25 ml poured into a graduated cylinder. This was put into a 50 ml settling chamber
and the graduated cylinder rinsed 3X. The sample was allowed to settle 48 h before being counted. If
"less than 25 ml aliquots were used, these were poured into 25 ml settling chambers which settle for 24 hr"
"before counting. To count, the entire chamber was examined at 200X with an inverted microscope to"
"obtain a minimum count of 100 organisms. If 100 organisms were not counted, another subsample is"
settled. Any organism that was abundant in the first aliquot (more than 60) was not counted. The count
program used for the net samples (see above) was currently being adapted for use with whole water
counts. The ITIS taxonomic codes were used for the taxa that are enumerated. Biomass estimates for
each taxon were applied to the normalized densities in order to fit into various ecosystem models and the
zooplankton index of biotic integrity.
Virginia Enumeration protocol from 1993-2009
-Chesapeake Bay Program Laboratory Method Code MI102
Samples are decanted from the replicate carboys of water collected at five discrete depths above the
pycnocline. Each 1-liter sample was allowed to settle for 72 hours and carefully siphoned down to a 300
"ml concentrated sample, which were then combined. A two-step settling and siphoning steps followed to"
"produce first a 250 ml concentrate, which was next concentrated to 100 ml. This concentrate was sieved"
"through 73 micron mesh net to trap microzooplankton >73 microns which were washed into a beaker,"
then placed into a settling chamber #1 for examination and counts. The filtrate was mixed and 3- 5ml
"aliquots were removed and placed in settling chamber #2, with a buffered formalin solution (20%) added"
"to bring the total volume to 25 ml. After 5 minutes of settling, 15 ml of the upper concentrate was removed"
"and placed in settling chamber #3. The settling chambers were allowed to settle for 24 hours, and then"
counts were made. The entire bottom surface of the settling chambers was scanned at 100x for chamber
#1 and at 200x for chamber #2 and #3 using an inverted plankton microscope. Chamber #1 provided
"counts for the larger microzooplankton (>73 microns), Chamber #2 for Microzooplankton groups between"
"40 and 73 microns in size, and Chamber #3 for small ciliates 
    "
"number of organisms per liter. In theory, Virginia’s MI102 organism counts for chambers #1 and #2"
should reflect the same taxa and life stages found in the Maryland MI101 organism counts.
