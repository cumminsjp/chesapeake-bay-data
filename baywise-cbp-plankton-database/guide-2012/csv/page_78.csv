The 2012 Users Guide to CBP Biological Monitoring Data
APPENDIX B – BIOLOGICAL DATA DICTIONARY
June 2012
This appendix contains the data dictionary of terms used in defining data fields in the CIMS/CDE
biological databases. Its purpose is to provide consistency within the CIMS/CDE databases by making
data submittal and retrieval compatible among institutions that participate in the program. This dictionary
will be expanded as new parameter and field names are required. Institutions submitting data to the CBP
monitoring database should use these variable names whenever possible so that names and units of
measure are consistent within the CBP monitoring database. Some of the terms in previous versions of
this dictionary have changed as the Chesapeake Bay Program Data Center implemented data dictionary
consolidation among monitoring programs.
"Each entry in this appendix lists the dictionary term name, a brief term description, and whether a term is"
"an attribute or value in as attribute field, a data type and field length."
