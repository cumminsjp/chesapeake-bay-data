OTHER ISSUES:,
1),The picoplankton count data are all identified taxonomically as Autotrophic Picoplankton in data
,set.
2),Composite samples: It should be noted that the CBP sampling protocol utilizes composite
,"samples. There are no samples for individual depths. At each station, samples were pumped"
,from five discrete depths in the surface layer above the pycnocline (or top half of the water
,column if a pycnocline is not evident) and composited in a 20-gallon carboy on shipboard.
,Picoplankton samples for enumeration are then drawn from the well mixed carboy.
