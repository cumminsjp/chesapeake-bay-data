OBTAINING MONITORING DATA
INFORMATION ACCESS THROUGH CHESAPEAKE DATA
ENTERPRISE
A major component of the CDE and its predecessor the CIMS network is to establish user interfaces for
information retrieval. The primary user interface is the data users World Wide Web browser. Users can
"search and download monitoring data, summary statistics and indicators, data documentation, key data"
management documents and data inventories from several interfaces via the CBP web site. The
"biological monitoring data can be obtained geographically, chronologically and programmatically."
"Customized data sets are generated when a data user submits search criteria (time, geographic location,"
"data type, etc.) to a monitoring database. Search results are returned to the user, as comma or tab"
delimited ASCII flat files or XML Schema formatted files. Routine monitoring data is also becoming
increasingly accessible through the GIS based Bay Stats web application. This interface enhancement
will allow for geographic and graphical analysis of data online. Other CBP databases and data
"management ""tools"" (e.g. QA/QC programs, documentation, and conversion tables and algorithms to"
calculate indicators) are being added to the web page server in installments.
CIMS/CDE WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS
The CBP has developed user-friendly graphical web interfaces for its relational databases of monitoring
data to allow data users self serve data retrieval. All biological point data sets and data documentation
"files are available online. A data user can now come to the web site, select basic data search criteria"
"(data type, time range, geographic area of interest, etc) and then submit data search criteria to the"
database. In turn the database will execute a search and return all the monitoring data which fits the
search parameters. Data can then be saved to the users local PC in an increasing number of formats.
