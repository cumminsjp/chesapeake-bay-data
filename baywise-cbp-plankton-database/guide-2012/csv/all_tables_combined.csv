THE 2012 USER'S GUIDE TO CHESAPEAKE BAY
PROGRAM BIOLOGICAL MONITORING DATA
INTRODUCTION
The 2012 User's Guide is intended to help data user’s access and use biological monitoring data
collected in as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program monitoring network. This guide describes many of
the biological databases currently available through the Chesapeake Data Enterprise (CDE) formerly the
Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS) in standardized structures and formats
(CIMS/CDE databases). It describes where the data and data products reside and how to obtain them.
Background
CHESAPEAKE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In 1996 the Chesapeake Executive Council adopted the Strategy for Increasing Basin-wide Public Access
to Chesapeake Bay Information. This strategy called for partners in the Chesapeake Bay Program to
develop and implement the Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS). The intent of CIMS
was to electronically link a variety of information about the Bay and its tributaries and make this
information available electronically through the Internet to a variety of audiences. The information
"targeted for distribution through CIMS included technical and public information, educational material,"
"environmental indicators, policy documents and scientific data."
"As a result of the CIMS initiative the various federal, state, academic and non-governmental organizations"
worked to establish a system of distributed databases. Many of the data assets available through CIMS
were hosted on the data originator’s Internet sites. The intent of the CIMS system was to provide a single
location from which all data assets would be available.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 13508
"On May 12, 2009, President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order that recognizes the Chesapeake"
Bay as a national treasure and calls on the federal government to lead a renewed effort to restore and
protect the nation’s largest estuary and its watershed.
The Executive Order directs CBP partners to “identify the mechanisms that will assure that governmental
"and other activities, including data collection and distribution, are coordinated and effective, relying on"
existing mechanisms where appropriate”.
"In 2010, in response to the Executive Order, the partnership began development of the Chesapeake Data"
Enterprise (CDE) based on the CIMS foundation. The data enterprise shares many of the same principles
"of CIMS, but broadens the partnership to include new data exchange partners and new data themes."
"Additionally, the data enterprise effort seeks to upgrade data exchange methods, adopt new standards,"
and refresh partnership agreements based on newer technologies and approaches.

•,Raw data: Typically the original field and laboratory results of monitoring programs. Data are
,collected and managed offsite by the data originators and not available from the CBP Data
,Center.
•,Primary data: Delivered to the CBP Data Center by the data originators. Many data sets are
,"currently available from the Data Center ""as is"" with their existing documentation. A long-term"
,goal of the CBP Data Center is to work with the data originators to produce primary data sets
,"that meet or come close to CIMS/CDE standards and specifications, and to de-emphasize use of"
,"primary data in favor of ""CIMS/CDE data."""
•,CBP Data: CBP monitoring databases or CIMS/CDE compliant databases which are available
,through the CIMS/CDE partners. All compliant databases follow common data dictionaries and
,data reporting standards. Biological point data become CIMS/CDE data after they are placed in
,"uniform, relational databases. Prior to loading data into the databases, data are rigorously"
,"checked for duplicate fields, outliers, erroneous data and other errors in the data are resolved"
,with the data providers. Biological point data in CIMS/CDE database structures are currently
,stored in relational databases on CBP Data Center servers and available to the public through a
,variety of interfaces on the Bay Program web site.
•,Ecosystem Indicator data: Datasets of technical indicators derived from monitoring data are now
,available. The information is computed from water quality and biological data in available
,databases using accepted algorithms and/or GIS methods. These forms of the data have been
,"demonstrated to be extremely useful to CBP participants, resource managers and the general"
,public.

OBTAINING MONITORING DATA
INFORMATION ACCESS THROUGH CHESAPEAKE DATA
ENTERPRISE
A major component of the CDE and its predecessor the CIMS network is to establish user interfaces for
information retrieval. The primary user interface is the data users World Wide Web browser. Users can
"search and download monitoring data, summary statistics and indicators, data documentation, key data"
management documents and data inventories from several interfaces via the CBP web site. The
"biological monitoring data can be obtained geographically, chronologically and programmatically."
"Customized data sets are generated when a data user submits search criteria (time, geographic location,"
"data type, etc.) to a monitoring database. Search results are returned to the user, as comma or tab"
delimited ASCII flat files or XML Schema formatted files. Routine monitoring data is also becoming
increasingly accessible through the GIS based Bay Stats web application. This interface enhancement
will allow for geographic and graphical analysis of data online. Other CBP databases and data
"management ""tools"" (e.g. QA/QC programs, documentation, and conversion tables and algorithms to"
calculate indicators) are being added to the web page server in installments.
CIMS/CDE WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS
The CBP has developed user-friendly graphical web interfaces for its relational databases of monitoring
data to allow data users self serve data retrieval. All biological point data sets and data documentation
"files are available online. A data user can now come to the web site, select basic data search criteria"
"(data type, time range, geographic area of interest, etc) and then submit data search criteria to the"
database. In turn the database will execute a search and return all the monitoring data which fits the
search parameters. Data can then be saved to the users local PC in an increasing number of formats.
Typical World Wide Web Data Retrieval from www.chesapeakebay.net

BIOLOGICAL DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE ISSUES
The goal of quality assurance is to provide the user with data of known high quality. The first stage of
"quality assurance is quality control (QC), which is performed by personnel in the field and laboratory to"
ensure that data meet quality standards. Quality assurance assessments for all data analyses measure
"two quantities, precision and accuracy. Precision is the repeatability of measurements, and accuracy is"
"the closeness of analytical measurements to a ""true"" value. In the case of biological data, enumeration"
accuracy is often method and personnel dependant. Although the accuracy of taxonomic identifications
"can only truly tested through cost prohibitive genetic analysis, accuracy is approximated well by"
consultation with taxonomic experts and the use of voucher collections.
Intra-organization QAQC
"Among the CBP biological programs, participating data providers have internal quality assurance/quality"
"control programs. To assess within-organization precision and accuracy, most programs standard"
protocolise randomly selected and re-enumerated approximately 5-10% samples for quality assurance.
"The QA sample assess,emt must have a total density and dominant taxa densities within 10% of the"
"original count. For CBPO funded or match programs, quality assurance recount data are submitted to"
CBP separately from the rest of the long term monitoring data and are maintained in an offline data base.
The QA recount data are available upon request.
Inter-organization QAQC
Inter-organization precision and accuracy assessments have been problematic in the biological
monitoring programs. The tidal benthic monitoring programs established and continue to maintain an
informal quality assurance program between participating labs during the early phases of the program.
"However, a program of regular quality assurance /quality control and split-sample comparisons between"
laboratories was not part of either the phytoplankton or zooplankton long-term monitoring programs prior
to 1998. From 1998 through 2008 a split-sampling program was conducted to compare results of the
"Maryland and Virginia mesozooplankton, microzooplankton and phytoplankton long-term monitoring"
programs. The non-tidal benthic monitoring programs currently have no mechanism for assessing
precision and accuracy between data providers.

TITLE: Phytoplankton Counts
PARAMETER NAME: COUNTS
UNITS OF MEASURE: Number of Cells per liter
"METHOD CODES: PH101, PH102, PH102M, PH103"
GENERAL INFORMATION:
The Chesapeake Bay phytoplankton monitoring data from the mainstem and tidal tributaries of Maryland
and Virginia collected prior to 2005 are not entirely comparable. While each lab used a version of the
"Utermohl counting methodology, differences in microscopic enumeration procedures produced data with"
significant method biases. In the Maryland phytoplankton program between 1984-2004 the counting
"procedure consisted of a two step procedure (USEPA Chesapeake Bay Program, 2006A). The primary"
counting magnification was 500X and 20 random fields were counted with a 200 cell count minimum. A
"secondary scan of 20 random fields to find the rarer, larger forms of the counting chamber was performed"
at 312X. In the Virginia phytoplankton monitoring program between 1985-2004 a three step counting
"procedure was used (USEPA Chesapeake Bay Program, 2006B). The primary counting magnification"
was at 300X and 10 random fields were counted with a 200 cell minimum. A secondary count of 10
random fields at 600X was performed to enumerate small cells not discernible at the 300x counted at
"600X. In the final step, the entire counting chamber was scanned at 150X for previously unrecorded"
larger species in the chamber. Another fundamental difference in these counts was the definition of an
"algal unit for enumeration. Virginia considered each colony, trichome or filament to be a single algal unit."
"Maryland considered each cell within a colony, tricome or filament to be an algal unit. Based on"
"comparison counts between the two labs, the end product of these counts at different magnifications was"
"that Maryland produced higher counts of smaller cells (
    "
or filamental forms due to lower raw counts. Virginia data consistently had higher species diversity. Based
"on this information and the results of the split sample comparisons, prior to 2005 Maryland and Virginia"
abundance data should be analyzed separately for baywide status and trends.
Maryland Enumeration protocol from 1984-2004
-Chesapeake Bay Program Analytical Method Code PH101
Samples are gently mixed and a 1-25 milliliter aliquot is transferred to a settling chamber. The aliquot is
brought up to 10-50 milliliter with deionized water (depending on the volume of the settling chamber).
"After a settling period of 2-48 hours (depending on the volume of the settling chamber), the settled"
material is examined at 400X or 500X and 250X or 312X using a Leitz Diavertla inverted microscope.
"Identification and enumeration of the dominant taxa, including detailed counts of the species, are made"
yielding densities (cells/liter) of individual taxa as well as the total assemblage. A minimum of twenty
random fields and 200 individual cells (not including blue-green spheres) are counted at 500X-400X. The
312X-250X count consists of the examination of twenty random fields counted for the rarer forms not
encountered in the high magnification counts. In 1989 after doing a comparison with epifluorescence
microscopy unidentified blue green spheres were no longer enumerated due to the inaccuracy of the
Utermohl method in estimating numbers of these cells. The remainder of the sample is permitted to settle
for at least 72 hours before concentrating the volume to 20-25 milliliters for archiving.

"undisturbed for 72 hours, the original 500 ml is reduced by careful siphoning to approximately 200-250"
ml. The samples are allowed to stand undisturbed for an additional 48 hours and are again siphoned to
"20-40 ml concentrates. The final 20-40 ml concentrate is transferred to a previously labeled storage vial,"
where the label information from the collection bottle has been transferred and verified by the laboratory
supervisor. A known volume of the entire concentrate will be placed in an Utermöhl settling chamber for

TITLE: Picoplankton Counts
PARAMETER NAME (NEW): COUNTS
UNITS OF MEASURE: Number of Cells per liter
"METHOD CODES: PP101, PP102"
GENERAL INFORMATION:
The 2008 phytoplankton split sample program examined the comparability of picoplankton counts
between program participants. The resulting split sample analysis showed high agreement (±5%
"difference) between laboratory counts. This suggest that despite the known differences in microscopes,"
"filter cubes and internal laboratory procedures, if like volumes of sample are enumerated good precision"
between the labs can be obtained.
Virginia Enumeration protocol from 1998-Present
-Chesapeake Bay Program Sample Analysis Method PP101
"When brought to the phytoplankton laboratory, samples (125 ml) will be stored in a refrigerator at 4 oC and"
the counting procedures will be completed within 7-14 days after their collection date. Using a millipore
"apparatus, a backing 0.45 um nuclepore filter, wetted with distilled water, is placed on the millipore stem."
"Then a blackened 0.20 um nuclepore filter, is placed over the other filter. 1-2 ml of the shaken water"
"sample is added to the filter apparatus. Using a pump, and a maximum vacuum pressure of 10 cm OF Hg"
"(13.3 kPa), the sample is filtered until the meniscus disappears from the top filter. The 0.2 um nuclepore"
filter is removed and placed immediately on a glass slide previously moistened with breath. A drop of
"immersion oil (Cargille type A, refractive index 1.515) is placed at the center of the filter, and then a cover"
"glass is added, followed by another drop of immersion oil to the cover glass. The slide is examined"
immediately with an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100-W Hg lamp and a 100X oil
immersion objective (Neofluar 100/1.30) at 1000X magnification. Using an appropriate filter set random
"field counts are made on both replicate samples, and averaged. A minimum coverage of 20 fields is the"
procedure followed for each slide. Cells not counted here are those previously identified and counted with
the phytoplankton sample at 300x or 600X (e.g. some Merismopedia spp.).
Maryland Enumeration protocol from 2002-Present
-Chesapeake Bay Program Analytical Method Code PP102
The field samples are returned to the lab and held in a refrigerator (4 0C) until processing begins (≤ 7
"days). Using a 25-mm Millipore filtration apparatus, a 0.45 μm backing filter is placed on the filter holder"
and moistened with distilled water. A 0.2 μm Irgalan black-stained nucleopore filter is placed on top of the
backing filter and the filter chimney attached to the base. An appropriate volume of sample water
(generally 1-2 ml) is placed in the chimney and filtered at a low vacuum pressure (~ 5 kPa). The
nucleopore filter is removed from the base and placed in the center of a glass microscope slide. A drop of
"immersion oil (Cargille type A) is placed in the middle of the filter, a cover slip placed on top and another"
drop of immersion oil added on top of the cover slip. The slide is gently tamped with a paper towel and
either examined immediately or placed in a slide box in a freezer until microscopic inspection occurs. The
glass slide holding the sample filter is placed on a Leitz Laborlux compound microscope outfitted with a
50-W mercury bulb and inspected at a magnification of 1250X. The autofluorescence characteristics of
the phototrophic picoplankton cells are detected by using two different filter sets - one with an excitation
wavelength of 450-490 nm which excites the chlorophyll a and type I phycoerythrins (common to the
"dominant group of picoplankton - cyanobacteria), the other a yellow-green wavelength of 520-560 nm"
which illuminates the type II phycoerythrins and the phycocyanins. A minimum of 200 cells and 20
random fields are counted.

TITLE: Primary Production
PARAMETER NAME (NEW): CARBONFIX
UNITS OF MEASURE: Microgram Carbon Per Liter Per Hour
"METHOD CODES: PD101, PD 102"
GENERAL INFORMATION:
"It was determined that the Maryland and Virginia primary production measurements, should be analyzed"
separately due shipboard methodology differences. The historic Maryland protocol collected 15 liter
samples and held the productivity samples at near-ambient temperatures and shipboard light conditions
for 0.5 - 6 hours. Thus samples were able to begin acclimating to relatively high light levels on shipboard
and samples may have experience above-ambient temperatures before they were placed in light-
"saturated, temperature-controlled incubation chambers in the laboratory. The historic Virginia protocol"
collected 1 liter samples and maintained productivity samples in a closed cooler on ice prior to being sent
to the laboratory for analysis. Virginia’s samples experienced below-ambient temperatures in all seasons
"but winter, and were acclimated to low light when they were placed in the incubation chambers. The end"
result of these protocol differences is that Maryland primary production rates appear to be consistently
different (greater) than Virginia rates.
Maryland Sample Analysis Protocol From 1984-2009
-Chesapeake Bay Program Analytical Method Code PD101
"At each station water column structure was assessed, water was pumped from five discrete depths above"
the pycnocline (or top half of the water column if a pycnocline is not evident) and composited in a 20-
gallon carboy on shipboard. Two composite samples were collected at each station. Carboys were held in
"varying conditions, for 6 hours, depending on station, but procedures were consistent for each"
station. Pre-incubation history can be classified into four groups:
Group A - Samples immediately put in a shipboard incubator chamber.
"TF1.5 - Patuxent River, tidal fresh"
"CB1.1 - mouth of the Susquehanna River, tidal fresh"
"CB2.2 - upper Bay mainstem, oligohaline (After February 2000)"
"CB3.3 - middle Bay mainstem, mesohaline"
"CB4.3 - middle Bay mainstem, mesohaline (After to February 2000)"
"WT5.1 - Baltimore Harbor, mesohaline"
"Group B - Unprotected samples which were taken immediately to shore, and transported"
between 1 - 2 hours in a van to the laboratory where they were placed immediately in the
laboratory incubator. Air temperature in the van was somewhat warmer than ambient in winter.
"The van was not air conditioned in summer prior to 2005, and summer samples may have"
"experience very warm temperatures. The samples also experience extremes in light conditions,"
from direct sunlight on shipboard to the interior darkness of a van.
"TF2.3 (~ 2 h) - upper Potomac River, tidal fresh"
"LE2.2 (~1 h) - lower Potomac River, mesohaline"
"CB5.2 (~1 h) - middle Bay, mesohaline"
"Group C - Samples were kept on shipboard in an unshaded, ambient temperature water bath"
"anywhere between 1 and 5.5 hours, then put in a shipboard incubator."
"CB2.2 – (~?) upper Bay mainstem, oligohaline (Prior to February 2000)"
"TF1.7 (~1 h) - middle Patuxent River, oligohaline"
"LE1.1 (~2.5 h) - lower Patuxent River, mesohaline"
"CB4.3 (~5.5 h) - middle Bay mainstem, mesohaline (Prior to February 2000)"
Group D - Samples were held unprotected on shipboard & van (~ 5 hours) or in the van (~3-4
"hours), then placed in the incubator. Samples experience temperature conditions that differ from"
"the ambient, i.e. typically colder in winter and hotter in summer. The van was heated in winter but"

not air conditioned in summer prior to 2005. The samples also experienced extremes in light
"conditions, from direct sunlight on shipboard to the interior darkness of a van."
"ET5.1 (~ 3 h) - upper Choptank, oligohaline"
"ET5.2 (~ 4 h) - lower Choptank, mesohaline"
"RET2.2 (~ 5 h) - middle Potomac River, oligohaline"
"Productivity incubation were performed either on shipboard, on a dock, or immediately upon returning to"
the laboratory. Four 100 ml subsamples per station were decanted from the two surface-layer composite
"samples into sample-rinsed Pyrex milk dilution bottles (or polycarbonate bottles after July, 1989). One"
"was used for a time-zero C14 blank (t 0), one for an alkalinity determination, and one from each composite"
for C 14 incubation. The incubation samples were placed in a constant light incubator (>250 μE m-2 sec -1)
"receiving running water maintained at ambient temperature for an acclimation period of more than 0.5 h,"
"and usually about 1 h. A 1-ml inoculate of 1-2 μCi labeled NaHCO 3 was added to each sample, and the"
"samples were returned to the incubator for >1 h. After incubation, 15 ml was filtered through a 0.45 μm"
"Millipore membrane filter, rinsed with filtered sample water, and fumed over concentrated HCl. Fifteen ml"
"of the t0 sample was similarly filtered and fumed, immediately following the addition of the radioisotope."
The filters were placed in scintillation vials and stored in a freezer. Scintillation cocktail (Aquasol from
August 1984 to October 1994; Cytoscint from October 1994 to present) was added to the scintillation vials
and the samples were run on a Packard Tri-Carb 2500TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer equipped with
internal quench standards and serviced once a year by the Packard technician. Field stock solutions of
radio-labeled NaHCO 3 were obtained from mixing portions of 25 mCi C 14 NaCO 3 stock solutions with pH
"of 10-10.2 de-ionized water. Final field stock activities approximate 2 μCi C 14 per ml, determined from"
liquid scintillation counting of field stocks in phenethylamine and Biofluor. Field stock activities for each
dilution are then recorded in a laboratory log and were assigned a date interval corresponding to the
period that the field stock is employed in the program.
Virginia Sample Analysis Protocol from 1998-2009
-Chesapeake Bay Program Sample Analysis Method PD102
"At each station water column structure was assessed, then water was pumped from five discrete depths"
above the pycnocline (or from top half of water column if pycnocline is absent) and composited in a
carboy. Two composite samples were collected at each station. Two 1-liter water samples were obtained
from each of the two carboys (total of 4 per station) and placed in an iced cooler until their return to the
laboratory. The Virginia protocol held all its samples for 6 hours on shipboard. Productivity
incubation were performed immediately upon returning to the laboratory. Two 100 ml subsamples were
obtained from each station’s two 1-liter composite samples (four from each station). One was used for an
"alkalinity determination, one was used for a time-zero C 14 blank (t0) after acclimation, and one from each"
composite was used for the C 14 incubation. Samples were placed in a water bath equipped with a bottle
holder which rotated between banks of cool-white fluorescent lights. The light levels exceed the light
saturation point of the phytoplankton. Temperature of the water bath was the same as the temperature at
"each station when the samples were taken. After one hour of acclimation, the bottles were inoculated with"
2-5 Ci C 14 NaHCO 3. One of the samples was analyzed for C 14 activity immediately (time 0 sample). Two
samples were returned to the water bath for approximately one hour. All inoculated samples were filtered
"through a 25 mm 0.45 pore-size Millipore filter under a vacuum pressure 
    "
Millipore filters were fumed over concentrated HCl for 30 seconds and placed in scintillation vials.
Scintillation fluid was added to each vial and C 14 activity was determined using a Beckman Model LS
1701 scintillation counter. The amount of C 14 in the stock bottle was determined by placing 20-50 μl of
stock solution in scintillation vials containing 0.5 ml phenethylamine. Scintillation fluid was added to the
"vials, set in the dark overnight, and analyzed for C 14 activity."

Maryland Enumeration protocols from 1984-2009
-Chesapeake Bay Program Laboratory Method Code MI101
Protocol for the enumeration of net collected microzooplankton samples. Samples were collected in
the field by pumpling a known quantity of water through a 44 μm mesh net. All samples collected in 44 μm
mesh nets are decanted into a jar containing buffered formaldehyde (final concentration of 2%) and
transferred to the laboratory. Samples were gently mixed and a 1-milliliter aliquot is removed with a
Stempel pipette and put into a Sedgewick-Rafter cell for enumeration with a compound microscope at
"100X magnification. Beginning with samples collected in April 1986, a small drop of concentrated Rose"
Bengal stain was added to the cell prior to addition of the sub sample. The sub sample was allowed to set
for 10 minutes before counting. At least one chamber (1 milliliter) was counted for each sample and if the
"total count did not reach 250 organisms, subsequent 1 milliliter aliquots were enumerated until a count of"
250 or more organisms was obtained or 3 milliliter was examined. If a certain organism was abundant
"(more than 60 per chamber), it was not counted in the subsequent 1 milliliter aliquot for a given sample."
"For extremely abundant taxa, less than one milliliter could be counted. Species identification were made"
using the NODC species code. Microzooplankton smaller than 44 micrometers were noted on the original
data sheet but not enumerated since estimates would not have been quantitative.
-Chesapeake Bay Program Laboratory Method Code MI103
Protocol for the enumeration of whole water collected microzooplankton samples. Samples are
decanted from the replicate carboys of water collected at five discrete depths above the pycnocline. The
whole water microzooplankton samples are preserved with acid Lugol’s solution to a final concentration of
"2 %. In the lab, 5-25 ml are subsampled from the sample jar for settling. This amount depends on how"
"much detritus and plankton were in the sample. If 25 ml was used, the bottle was shaken gently (slowly"
inverted 5 times) and 25 ml poured into a graduated cylinder. This was put into a 50 ml settling chamber
and the graduated cylinder rinsed 3X. The sample was allowed to settle 48 h before being counted. If
"less than 25 ml aliquots were used, these were poured into 25 ml settling chambers which settle for 24 hr"
"before counting. To count, the entire chamber was examined at 200X with an inverted microscope to"
"obtain a minimum count of 100 organisms. If 100 organisms were not counted, another subsample is"
settled. Any organism that was abundant in the first aliquot (more than 60) was not counted. The count
program used for the net samples (see above) was currently being adapted for use with whole water
counts. The ITIS taxonomic codes were used for the taxa that are enumerated. Biomass estimates for
each taxon were applied to the normalized densities in order to fit into various ecosystem models and the
zooplankton index of biotic integrity.
Virginia Enumeration protocol from 1993-2009
-Chesapeake Bay Program Laboratory Method Code MI102
Samples are decanted from the replicate carboys of water collected at five discrete depths above the
pycnocline. Each 1-liter sample was allowed to settle for 72 hours and carefully siphoned down to a 300
"ml concentrated sample, which were then combined. A two-step settling and siphoning steps followed to"
"produce first a 250 ml concentrate, which was next concentrated to 100 ml. This concentrate was sieved"
"through 73 micron mesh net to trap microzooplankton >73 microns which were washed into a beaker,"
then placed into a settling chamber #1 for examination and counts. The filtrate was mixed and 3- 5ml
"aliquots were removed and placed in settling chamber #2, with a buffered formalin solution (20%) added"
"to bring the total volume to 25 ml. After 5 minutes of settling, 15 ml of the upper concentrate was removed"
"and placed in settling chamber #3. The settling chambers were allowed to settle for 24 hours, and then"
counts were made. The entire bottom surface of the settling chambers was scanned at 100x for chamber
#1 and at 200x for chamber #2 and #3 using an inverted plankton microscope. Chamber #1 provided
"counts for the larger microzooplankton (>73 microns), Chamber #2 for Microzooplankton groups between"
"40 and 73 microns in size, and Chamber #3 for small ciliates 
    "
"number of organisms per liter. In theory, Virginia’s MI102 organism counts for chambers #1 and #2"
should reflect the same taxa and life stages found in the Maryland MI101 organism counts.

OTHER ISSUES:,
1),Mesozooplankton counts are reported in organisms per cubic meters. Microzooplankton counts are
,reported in organisms per liter. One of the data sets must have its units converted before combining
,the data sets The conversion is for converting mesozooplankton into microzooplankton units is:
,DEN_M3 / 1000 = DEN_L
2),Maryland Microzooplankton SAMPLE_ NUMBER: Note that the Maryland microzooplankton
,SAMPLE_NUMBERs are sample identifiers; they are not synonymous with a replicate number.
,"Please perform a count of SAMPLE_NUMBER by STATION, SAMPLE_DATE, LAYER and SOURCE"
,to determine the number of replicate samples taken at a station.
3),Virginia Specific Issue-Analysis of the July-December 1999 data deliverables revealed abnormally
,high counts of Oligotrichs were found at numerous stations. It is unclear whether this increase was
,due to natural phenomena or some kind of taxonomist bias due to the introduction of new personnel.
4),Virginia Specific Issues-The 2002 split sample study revealed that the phytoplankton genus Ceratium
,was being mistaken as rotifers in routine and split sample counts. Phytoplankton samples with high
,Ceratium counts were identified and the corresponding microzooplankton samples were recounted
,and resubmitted from the time period between July 1999-December 2001. ODU taxonomists were
,also noted as finding high counts of Oligotrichs in split samples where Maryland personnel did not
,find these. No explanation for this finding has been determined to date.

PARAMETER NAME (NEW): COUNTS
UNITS OF MEASURE: Number per liter
"METHOD CODES: MZ101A, MZ101B. MZ101C, MZ102, MZ103"
GENERAL INFORMATION:
"After extensive examination of historic mesozooplankton monitoring data, and in consideration of the"
"known methodological and data quality issues, the CBP is issuing the following data usage"
recommendation: Only mesozooplankton samples enumerated with Hensen-Stempel (HS) methodologies
"are recommended for use in quantitative analyses. These data have method codes MZ101A, MZ101B,"
"MZ101C, and MZ103. Data quality issues have been identified for portions of the Virginia record."
"Virginia samples collected prior to 1993 and enumerated with method MZ102, as well as those samples"
"collected between 1993 and 2000 and enumerated with method MZ102 or MZ102B, should only be used"
for qualitative purposes (Johnson 2007).Baywide sampling for mesozooplankton ended in September
2002 due to the termination of the CBP zooplankton monitoring program in October 2002.
Maryland Enumeration protocols from 1984-2009
"-Chesapeake Bay Program Laboratory Method Code MZ101A, MZ101B, MZ101C"
"Mesozooplankton were collected in the field, with stepped oblique bongo net tows at each station. Bongo"
nets were deployed 0.5 meters above the bottom and nets were raised in 1-4 meter increments (usually
0.5 to 1.5 minutes/step) depending on station depth with a minimum of 5 steps per station. In the
"laboratory, samples were enumerated using a standard sub-sampling technique with a Hensen-Stempel"
pipette (HS) (Harris et.al. 2000). A hierarchical counting technique was employed to obtain density
estimates. This procedure consists of first counting at least 60 individuals of the most dominant forms
"(e.g. Acartia tonsa) in a small sub sample (usually 1 - 2 milliliters), followed by 5- and 10- milliliter sub"
samples from which all species that had counts less than 60 in the previous sub sample were counted.
The basic technique was modified slightly three times over the 18 year history of the program. The
"standard HS count and a whole sample scan for macrozooplankton (amphipods, shrimp, fish eggs, fish"
"larvae and juvenile fish, etc.) was performed on each sample between 1984 and 1989. The"
macrozooplankton sample scan was temporarily discontinued from 1990 to 1996 (MZ101B). In 1996 the
macro-zooplankton scan was reinstated and large bodied mesozooplankton species occurring in small
numbers in the initial count were enumerated in special 850-micron sieve counts were again reported
(MZ101C). Note that after 1 January 1999 smaller species occurring in small numbers in the standard
count but occurred predominantly in the special 850-micron sieve counts were reported only in the
method MZ 101C count.
Virginia Enumeration protocols from 1984-2009
"-Chesapeake Bay Program Analytical Method Code-MZ102, MZ102B"
Field samples were collected by taking five minute double-oblique pattern bongo net tows from bottom to
"surface. From1985 to 1992, the bongo nets used for field sampling were not equipped with flow meters to"
accurately estimate the volume of water filtered through the nets during a tow. The volume of water
"filtered during a tow was estimated using the length of the tow and area of the net’s opening. In 1993, a"
flow meter were mounted on the nets. From 1985 through 1997 a Controlled Variability Sampling (CVS)
method (method MZ102) described by Alden et.al. 1982 was used for sample enumeration. The CVS
"technique used a connected series of five wet sieves (200, 300, 600, 850, and 2000 microns) and a"
mechanized shaking apparatus to separate and zooplankton were then counted by size fraction. Size
classes in which the organisms were too numerous to count in their entirety were split with a Folsom
plankton splitter until an appropriate sample size is reached for statistically valid counts of the dominant
species. The chosen error level of 35% required that each species of interest be counted to achieve a

TITLE: Horizontal and Vertical Fluorescence
PARAMETER NAME (NEW): CHL_F
UNITS OF MEASURE: micrograms chlorophyll per liter
"METHOD CODES: 101, 102,103, 104,105,106,107,108,109,110"
GENERAL INFORMATION:
After a series of quality assurance inquiries it has been determined that the horizontal and vertical
fluorescence monitoring data has a variety of quality issues that users need to be aware of. Data quality
issues include positional accuracy of horizontal fluorescence data collected prior to 2000 and calibration
issues in the Maryland data associated with the regression curves used to covert fluorescence voltages to
chlorophyll a values.
Sampling Site Position Determination Issues
The Maryland horizontal fluorescence data collected by Morgan State University between 1984 and April
1999 (excluding the special Potomac survey) and all Virginia horizontal fluorescence collected by Old
Dominion University between 1991 and 1997 had station latitudes and longitudes estimated through an
interpolation process. The latitudes and longitudes are at best approximations of actual positions in the
field. Inaccuracies in the estimated station locations may be problematic in mapping or ground truthing
applications.
"For purposes of determining the actual geographical location of a reading, sampling station location along"
transects was determined using the simple geometry of right triangles to compute latitude and longitude.
Calculations were based on the following assumptions: a) the transect was over a straight line from
"departure station to arrival station, b) boat speed was assumed to be constant, c) the Latitudes and"
Longitudes of end point stations were fixed points. Equations were based on the relationship of total strip
recorder tape length being proportional to actual distance between stations. Sampling position was based
on the distance from the starting position of the strip recorder tape of the at-sample time against the total
length of the tape at the destination station.
Also note that all horizontal and vertical fluorescence with direct position reporting by LORAN-C collected
in Virginia from 1991-1995 and Maryland from 1984-1999 does not meet current EPA sampling position
policy. The current EPA sampling position policy requires that position be measured with a Global
Positioning System (GPS). However locations determined with Loran-C and should be less problematic
in mapping or ground truthing applications and reasonable approximations of actual location.
Fluorescence Value Calculation Issues
"As part of a remote sensing ground truthing exercise in 1998, comparison of interpolated Maryland"
horizontal fluorescence and water quality surface chlorophyll a data was made. Comparisons revealed
that the existing fluorescence chlorophyll a values were “orders of magnitude lower than corresponding
water quality values”. These differences were not present in the corresponding Virginia data. While in-situ
"fluorescence values are generally accepted to be depressed measurements of chlorophyll, the magnitude"
of the differences warranted further investigation.
A comparison both the Maryland and Virginia sampling protocols revealed two significant issues affecting
data values. Although both programs used periodic grab samples to create a regression to convert
"instrument voltage to chlorophyll a values, the regressions were calculated differently. Both Virginia"
laboratories were doing daily regression curves wile Maryland computed a single curve based on all 3
days of a sampling cruise. Additionally the Maryland laboratory analysis method for grab chlorophyll
samples was determined to be significantly different from the standard CBP water quality chlorophyll
40
The 2012 Users Guide to CBP Biological Monitoring Data
protocol. Several changes were made to the Maryland program to remedy these issues. All fluorescence
"data collected by both states after 1998 was reported with its corresponding instrument voltages, to allow"
recalculation od daily fluorescence curves from alterative grab chlorophyll data. Maryland switched to
computing daily regressions for fluorescence and adopted the standard CBP water quality method for
analysis of grab chlorophyll samples in 2000.
OTHER ISSUES:
Please see individual project documentation for cruise notes for specifics on missing data and changes to
standard regression calculation protocol for specific dates

ECOSYSTEM INDICATORS
Teams of Chesapeake Bay Program scientists and natural resource managers have worked to develop
indicators of Chesapeake Bay ecosystem health. These indicators are calculated from a broad range of
monitoring data and provide an indication of status of the Bay ecosystem. The technical indicators are
"used primarily in the interpretation, synthesis and communication of monitoring results. The biological"
indicators are expected to provide quantitative information on food chain responses to nutrient and
sediment load reductions in the Chesapeake Bay. Indicators are also potentially useful in ongoing efforts
to develop biocriteria and restoration targets for state waters. There are a number of technical indicators
for various trophic groups currently under development or in peer review. Currently the Bay Program uses
ten biological indicators (5 fisheries and 5 lower trophic level) to characterize bay and watershed health.
The summaries below provide an overview of indicators currently used to report on the status ecosystem
health based on data managed at the data center: macroinvertebrates and phytoplankton in tidal waters
and macroinvertebrates in non-tidal waters. There was an additional Zooplankton community indicators
developed in 2006 but is not described here because CBP zooplankton monitoring programs have been
discontinued (Carpenter et al 2006).
THE BENTHIC INDEX OF BIOTIC INTEGRITY
The Chesapeake Bay Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (BIBI) initially released in 1997 (Weisberg et al.
1997) was meant to be a tool for assessing the status of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in tidal
"waters. In subsequent years, a series of statistical and simulation studies were conducted to evaluate and"
optimize the B-IBI (Alden et al. 2002). The results of Alden et al. (2002) indicated that the B-IBI is
"sensitive, stable, robust, and statistically sound. New sets of metric and threshold combinations for the"
tidal freshwater and oligohaline habitats were also developed in Alden et al. (2002) with a larger dataset
"than was available to Weisberg et al. (1997) for these two habitats. Since its introduction, the index has"
been used in a variety of restoration and habitat targeting efforts (Dalal et al. 1999). It has been
incorporated into the Chesapeake Bay Health Index developed by Williams et al. 2009. The BIBI makes a
good integrator of long-term environmental conditions because benthic organisms have limited mobility
and their responses to stress are well documented. The current indices are both habitat and seasonally
"dependent. Therefore, data must be selected for time of the year and preclassified for habitat conditions."
The Chesapeake Bay B-IBI is calculated by scoring each of several attributes of benthic
"macroinvertebrate community structure and function (abundance, biomass, diversity, etc.) according to"
thresholds derived from reference communities. The unweighted scores (on a 1 to 5 scale) are then
averaged across attributes to calculate an index value. Samples with index values of 3.0 or more are
considered to have good benthic condition indicative of good habitat quality. The current summary
statistics are as follows:
Shannon-Weiner Species Diversity Index
Total Species Abundance
Total Species Biomass
Percent Abundance of Pollution-Indicative Species
Percent Abundance of Pollution-Sensitive Species
Percent Biomass of Pollution-Indicative Species
Percent Biomass of Pollution-Sensitive Species
Percent Abundance of Carnivores and Omnivores
Percent Abundance of Deep Deposit Feeders
Tolerance Score
Tanypodinae to Chironomidae percent abundance ratio

The 2012 Users Guide to CBP Biological Monitoring Data
APPENDIX B – BIOLOGICAL DATA DICTIONARY
June 2012
This appendix contains the data dictionary of terms used in defining data fields in the CIMS/CDE
biological databases. Its purpose is to provide consistency within the CIMS/CDE databases by making
data submittal and retrieval compatible among institutions that participate in the program. This dictionary
will be expanded as new parameter and field names are required. Institutions submitting data to the CBP
monitoring database should use these variable names whenever possible so that names and units of
measure are consistent within the CBP monitoring database. Some of the terms in previous versions of
this dictionary have changed as the Chesapeake Bay Program Data Center implemented data dictionary
consolidation among monitoring programs.
"Each entry in this appendix lists the dictionary term name, a brief term description, and whether a term is"
"an attribute or value in as attribute field, a data type and field length."
