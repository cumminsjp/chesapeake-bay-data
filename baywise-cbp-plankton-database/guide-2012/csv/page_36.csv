OTHER ISSUES:,
1),Mesozooplankton counts are reported in organisms per cubic meters. Microzooplankton counts are
,reported in organisms per liter. One of the data sets must have its units converted before combining
,the data sets The conversion is for converting mesozooplankton into microzooplankton units is:
,DEN_M3 / 1000 = DEN_L
2),Maryland Microzooplankton SAMPLE_ NUMBER: Note that the Maryland microzooplankton
,SAMPLE_NUMBERs are sample identifiers; they are not synonymous with a replicate number.
,"Please perform a count of SAMPLE_NUMBER by STATION, SAMPLE_DATE, LAYER and SOURCE"
,to determine the number of replicate samples taken at a station.
3),Virginia Specific Issue-Analysis of the July-December 1999 data deliverables revealed abnormally
,high counts of Oligotrichs were found at numerous stations. It is unclear whether this increase was
,due to natural phenomena or some kind of taxonomist bias due to the introduction of new personnel.
4),Virginia Specific Issues-The 2002 split sample study revealed that the phytoplankton genus Ceratium
,was being mistaken as rotifers in routine and split sample counts. Phytoplankton samples with high
,Ceratium counts were identified and the corresponding microzooplankton samples were recounted
,and resubmitted from the time period between July 1999-December 2001. ODU taxonomists were
,also noted as finding high counts of Oligotrichs in split samples where Maryland personnel did not
,find these. No explanation for this finding has been determined to date.
