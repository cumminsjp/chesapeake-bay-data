GENERAL INFORMATION:
The Chesapeake Bay phytoplankton monitoring data from the mainstem and tidal tributaries of Maryland
and Virginia collected prior to 2005 are not entirely comparable. While each lab used a version of the
"Utermohl counting methodology, differences in microscopic enumeration procedures produced data with"
significant method biases. In the Maryland phytoplankton program between 1984-2004 the counting
"procedure consisted of a two step procedure (USEPA Chesapeake Bay Program, 2006A). The primary"
counting magnification was 500X and 20 random fields were counted with a 200 cell count minimum. A
"secondary scan of 20 random fields to find the rarer, larger forms of the counting chamber was performed"
at 312X. In the Virginia phytoplankton monitoring program between 1985-2004 a three step counting
"procedure was used (USEPA Chesapeake Bay Program, 2006B). The primary counting magnification"
was at 300X and 10 random fields were counted with a 200 cell minimum. A secondary count of 10
random fields at 600X was performed to enumerate small cells not discernible at the 300x counted at
"600X. In the final step, the entire counting chamber was scanned at 150X for previously unrecorded"
larger species in the chamber. Another fundamental difference in these counts was the definition of an
"algal unit for enumeration. Virginia considered each colony, trichome or filament to be a single algal unit."
"Maryland considered each cell within a colony, tricome or filament to be an algal unit. Based on"
"comparison counts between the two labs, the end product of these counts at different magnifications was"
"that Maryland produced higher counts of smaller cells (
    "
or filamental forms due to lower raw counts. Virginia data consistently had higher species diversity. Based
"on this information and the results of the split sample comparisons, prior to 2005 Maryland and Virginia"
abundance data should be analyzed separately for baywide status and trends.

-Chesapeake Bay Program Analytical Method Code PH101
Samples are gently mixed and a 1-25 milliliter aliquot is transferred to a settling chamber. The aliquot is
brought up to 10-50 milliliter with deionized water (depending on the volume of the settling chamber).
"After a settling period of 2-48 hours (depending on the volume of the settling chamber), the settled"
material is examined at 400X or 500X and 250X or 312X using a Leitz Diavertla inverted microscope.
"Identification and enumeration of the dominant taxa, including detailed counts of the species, are made"
yielding densities (cells/liter) of individual taxa as well as the total assemblage. A minimum of twenty
random fields and 200 individual cells (not including blue-green spheres) are counted at 500X-400X. The
312X-250X count consists of the examination of twenty random fields counted for the rarer forms not
encountered in the high magnification counts. In 1989 after doing a comparison with epifluorescence
microscopy unidentified blue green spheres were no longer enumerated due to the inaccuracy of the
Utermohl method in estimating numbers of these cells. The remainder of the sample is permitted to settle
for at least 72 hours before concentrating the volume to 20-25 milliliters for archiving.

"The 500 ml replicate sample sets are mixed (1000 ml), then 500 ml are withdrawn and allowed to settle"
"undisturbed for 72 hours, the original 500 ml is reduced by careful siphoning to approximately 200-250"
ml. The samples are allowed to stand undisturbed for an additional 48 hours and are again siphoned to
"20-40 ml concentrates. The final 20-40 ml concentrate is transferred to a previously labeled storage vial,"
where the label information from the collection bottle has been transferred and verified by the laboratory
supervisor. A known volume of the entire concentrate will be placed in an Utermöhl settling chamber for
