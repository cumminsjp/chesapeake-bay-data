ECOSYSTEM INDICATORS
Teams of Chesapeake Bay Program scientists and natural resource managers have worked to develop
indicators of Chesapeake Bay ecosystem health. These indicators are calculated from a broad range of
monitoring data and provide an indication of status of the Bay ecosystem. The technical indicators are
"used primarily in the interpretation, synthesis and communication of monitoring results. The biological"
indicators are expected to provide quantitative information on food chain responses to nutrient and
sediment load reductions in the Chesapeake Bay. Indicators are also potentially useful in ongoing efforts
to develop biocriteria and restoration targets for state waters. There are a number of technical indicators
for various trophic groups currently under development or in peer review. Currently the Bay Program uses
ten biological indicators (5 fisheries and 5 lower trophic level) to characterize bay and watershed health.
The summaries below provide an overview of indicators currently used to report on the status ecosystem
health based on data managed at the data center: macroinvertebrates and phytoplankton in tidal waters
and macroinvertebrates in non-tidal waters. There was an additional Zooplankton community indicators
developed in 2006 but is not described here because CBP zooplankton monitoring programs have been
discontinued (Carpenter et al 2006).
THE BENTHIC INDEX OF BIOTIC INTEGRITY
The Chesapeake Bay Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (BIBI) initially released in 1997 (Weisberg et al.
1997) was meant to be a tool for assessing the status of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in tidal
"waters. In subsequent years, a series of statistical and simulation studies were conducted to evaluate and"
optimize the B-IBI (Alden et al. 2002). The results of Alden et al. (2002) indicated that the B-IBI is
"sensitive, stable, robust, and statistically sound. New sets of metric and threshold combinations for the"
tidal freshwater and oligohaline habitats were also developed in Alden et al. (2002) with a larger dataset
"than was available to Weisberg et al. (1997) for these two habitats. Since its introduction, the index has"
been used in a variety of restoration and habitat targeting efforts (Dalal et al. 1999). It has been
incorporated into the Chesapeake Bay Health Index developed by Williams et al. 2009. The BIBI makes a
good integrator of long-term environmental conditions because benthic organisms have limited mobility
and their responses to stress are well documented. The current indices are both habitat and seasonally
"dependent. Therefore, data must be selected for time of the year and preclassified for habitat conditions."
The Chesapeake Bay B-IBI is calculated by scoring each of several attributes of benthic
"macroinvertebrate community structure and function (abundance, biomass, diversity, etc.) according to"
thresholds derived from reference communities. The unweighted scores (on a 1 to 5 scale) are then
averaged across attributes to calculate an index value. Samples with index values of 3.0 or more are
considered to have good benthic condition indicative of good habitat quality. The current summary
statistics are as follows:
Shannon-Weiner Species Diversity Index
Total Species Abundance
Total Species Biomass
Percent Abundance of Pollution-Indicative Species
Percent Abundance of Pollution-Sensitive Species
Percent Biomass of Pollution-Indicative Species
Percent Biomass of Pollution-Sensitive Species
Percent Abundance of Carnivores and Omnivores
Percent Abundance of Deep Deposit Feeders
Tolerance Score
Tanypodinae to Chironomidae percent abundance ratio
