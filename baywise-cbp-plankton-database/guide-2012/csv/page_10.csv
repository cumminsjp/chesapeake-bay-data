•,Raw data: Typically the original field and laboratory results of monitoring programs. Data are
,collected and managed offsite by the data originators and not available from the CBP Data
,Center.
•,Primary data: Delivered to the CBP Data Center by the data originators. Many data sets are
,"currently available from the Data Center ""as is"" with their existing documentation. A long-term"
,goal of the CBP Data Center is to work with the data originators to produce primary data sets
,"that meet or come close to CIMS/CDE standards and specifications, and to de-emphasize use of"
,"primary data in favor of ""CIMS/CDE data."""
•,CBP Data: CBP monitoring databases or CIMS/CDE compliant databases which are available
,through the CIMS/CDE partners. All compliant databases follow common data dictionaries and
,data reporting standards. Biological point data become CIMS/CDE data after they are placed in
,"uniform, relational databases. Prior to loading data into the databases, data are rigorously"
,"checked for duplicate fields, outliers, erroneous data and other errors in the data are resolved"
,with the data providers. Biological point data in CIMS/CDE database structures are currently
,stored in relational databases on CBP Data Center servers and available to the public through a
,variety of interfaces on the Bay Program web site.
•,Ecosystem Indicator data: Datasets of technical indicators derived from monitoring data are now
,available. The information is computed from water quality and biological data in available
,databases using accepted algorithms and/or GIS methods. These forms of the data have been
,"demonstrated to be extremely useful to CBP participants, resource managers and the general"
,public.
