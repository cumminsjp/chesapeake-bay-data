  Description:
    Abstract: Public Shellfising Areas of the Chesapeake Bay and Its Tidal Tributaries June 2012 incorporated by reference effective October 1, 2012. Previous versions of this data were distributed in December of 2010 and August of 2011.
    Purpose:
      The purpose of this data was to create a digital map layer of Maryland's Public Shellfish Fishery Areas, which are areas open for commercial harvest.
      The coordinates used to create this file are estimated to be accurate to 2 meters. In some cases, slight overlaps in adjacent PSFA's will appear. Appropriate scale for this data is between 1:10,000 and 1:1,000,000. This dataset was created for management purposes only. For the official boundaries, please consult the Annotated Code of Maryland. Printed or electronic media created with this data should bear the following disclaimer: "The lines shown are for oyster management purposes only. For the official boundary(ies) consult Maryland D.N.R.'s Hydrographic Operations Division."
