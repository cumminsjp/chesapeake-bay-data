  Description:
    Abstract: Maryland Tributary Teams-comprised of local citizens, farmers, business leaders and government officials appointed by the Governor-are working to keep local waterways clean and healthy.  TheTributary Team jurisdictions were determined from the watershed boundaries that were developed in a joint state and federal effort to create a consistent watershed file for use by all government agencies with an interest in Maryland's watersheds.
    Purpose: The Tributary Strategy Areas were identified to represent the major drainage basins of Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay.  The watershed file is generally considered to be map accurate at a scale of 1:24,000.
