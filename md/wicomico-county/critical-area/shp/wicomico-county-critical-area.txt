  Description:
    Abstract:
      In 1984, the General Assembly enacted the Chesapeake
      Bay Critical Area Act to regulate development, manage
      land use and conserve natural resources on land in those
      areas designated as Critical Area. For this document, the
      Critical Area is all land and water areas within 1000 feet
      of the tidal waters' edge or from the landward edge of
      adjacent tidal wetlands and the lands under them.
      Georeferenced digital data files of the critical Area have
      been produced for Baltimore City and the 16 Maryland
      counties with land located within the Critical Area.  The
      digital maps produced for each jurisdiction are polygons
      depicting the Critical Area and the land use classifications
      recognized by the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area
      Commission (CBCAC).   Each jurisdiction is a separate file.
      The data were produced from hard copy parcel maps
      originally submitted by the counties as part of the
      requirements for developing their Critical Area Program.
    Purpose:
      All of the 60 jurisdictions (16 counties and 44
      municipalities) within the Critical  Area are required to
      establish land use policies for development that will
      accommodate growth and minimize the impact of human
      activities on the Bay.  As a result, the local jurisdictions are
      required to inventory or map a variety of resources in order
      to be able to monitor the implementation of the local programs.
      The CBCAC needed a tool that could help its staff oversee the
      implementation of the approved local programs and to track
      development activities in the Critical Area.  Thus, CBCAC
      undertook the digitization of county Critical Area maps in a
      cooperative effort with other State Agencies: the Maryland
      Department of Planning (MDP), the Department of Assessment
      and Taxation (DAT) and different units of the Department of
      Natural Resources (DNR).

    This data set represents the Department of Natural Resources interpretation of the location and extent of the Critical Area; however, the digital maps are not recognized as the "official" maps.  In accordance with Subsection 8-1807(a) of the Critical Area Act, the Critical Area consists of (1) All waters and lands under the Chesapeake Bay and
    its tributaries to the head of tide as indicated on the State wetland maps, and all State and private wetlands designated under Environment Article, Title 16, annotated Code of Maryland; (2) All land and water areas within 1,000 feet beyond the landward boundaries of State or private wetlands and the of tides designated under Environment Article, Article 16, Annotated Code of Maryland; and (3) Modification to these areas through inclusions or exclusions proposed by local jurisdictions and approved by Commission as specified in Natural Resources Article, Subsection 8-1807, annotated Code of Maryland.  These maps are hard copy maps that cannot be exactly replicated in a digital format; therefore, some interpretation was necessary to create the digital line.  Hard copy maps depicting the official Critical Area boundary line are available for review at the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission, and at most local planning and zoning departments.

  Data_Set_Credit:
    There were many parties involved in producing Maryland's
    Critical Area data and the key parties will be listed.  Each
    county and city (listed below) produced a hard copy map
    and submitted the map to the Chesapeake Bay Critical
    Area Commission (CBCAC) for approval.  Through Coastal Zone
    Management grants, CBCAC digitized the county data.
    Maryland DNR's Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed
    Service finalized the data and is handling data distribution.

  Native_Data_Set_Environment:
    This data has been a work in progress for a number of
    years.  As a consequence, the hardware and software
    have evolved numerous times since the project began.
    The Critical Area maps were digitized using Altek
    and GTCO 60" x 48" digitizer and AutoCAD version 9.
    Workstation ARC/INFO (version unknown), PC ARC/INFO
    version 3.4D,  ARC View version 3.0 and Arc/View
    version 3.2, and Mico Images TNT mip's version 6.4 were
    used to produce and provide quality control on the data.
Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The accuracy of attributes are based on the correctness of
      what was presented on the maps submitted by the local
      agencies for approval by Chesapeake Bay Critical Area
      Commission.  The polygons were compared to each of the
      county maps to ensure that there were attributes associated
      with each polygon, that the attributes were within set values,
      and matained consistency with the hard copy maps.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Each area is a closed polygon.  Each polygon has a
    centroid created by PC ARC/INFO where the attribute is
    attached.  Extra nodes and label points have been
    removed.  Polygons were checked and all of the polygons
    are essential to meet the rules set for creation of the file.
    Dangles and overshoots have been removed.
  Completeness_Report:
    The Critical Area boundary line data is visually inspected for
    completeness by comparing the data with the hardcopy Critical Area
    boundary line maps.  All attribute divisions are matched to the Property
    View Parcel data and shoreline matched to the CNES, Inc. Panchromatic
    spot imagery.  All upland areas 1000 feet from the tidal portion of the
    Chesapeake Bay have been designated as the "Critical Area" in
    accordance with subsection 8-1807, of the Critical Area Act.
    However due to zoning considerations and local planning processes, the
    1000 foot line may not be altered in some areas.  The Chesapeake Bay
    Critical Area Commission independently reviewed the data for
    completeness and consistency to set standards.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The source material coordinates were Maryland State
        Plane 1927 (NAD 1927) and units in feet.  All subsequent
        work retained the same coordinates and units.  The
        original source material was either 24000 scale 7.5
        quadrangle maps or 7200 scale parcel maps.  In some cases,
        adjustments to the vectors were necessary to improve the
        accuracy of the fit over 10 meter panchromatic SPOT satellite
        imagery.  Therefore, the data is considered map accurate to a
        scale of 1:24,000.  Operator "best judgement" was used
        concerning the positional accuracy.  There were no definitive
        assessments made to determine a quantitative measure of the
        accuracy.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: There were no vertical references.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Work done in the first phase is not well documented due to the age of the project, the variety of parties involved, and change in personnel.  Each county produced hard copy critical area boundary line maps.  However, that process is not documented.  Initially the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission started the arduous process of digitizing the hard copy maps.  This process is also not documented.  It is believed that most of this was done in ARC CAD or Auto CAD due to the type of files received from the commission.  Attribution of the polygons was not completed at that time.  The Maryland Department of Planning was involved in attributing some if not all of the polygon line work.  And sometime during this process, the files were merged into county files.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The second phase of the process was to compile all previous work.  The Maryland DNR’s Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service, GIS Division obtained the digital data sets (Arc coverage files, Arc export files, Arc shape files, and in some cases Cad files) by county for the critical area boundary lines.  The county data sets with multiple files were then merged into individual county files using PC ARC/INFO version 3.5.  In some cases adjustments had to be made in order to merge data sets where there were positional and length inaccuracies between the data sets.   Positional accuracy of the county files was accomplished by visually matching the county files to 10 meter panchromatic SPOT satellite imagery (1994-1995).  At this point all data was registered to MD State Plane 1927 (NAD1927) with units measured in feet. All county files were then checked for shoreline fit.  If there were inaccuracies between the SPOT imagery and the critical area data files, some data shifting (rubber sheeting) was necessary to make the data as accurate as possible.  When all edits were completed, the data was built and cleaned (using PC ARC/INFO version 3.5) to meet MD-DNR 1-24,000 scale standards

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The third phase of the process was to compare the Critical Area data files to the hard copy maps produced by the counties and the 1972 State tidal wetland maps for Maryland.  The data files were viewed (using ARC View 3.2) over the 10-meter panochromatic SPOT imagery (1998) and the MD Property View parcel images for this process.  The data was then compared and measured at a scale of 1-10,000 to the hard copy critical area boundary line maps provided by the Critical Area Commission.  Discrepancies in the data files were corrected based upon the distance and labels represented in the hardcopy maps. When a discrepancy could not be resolved, Mary Owens of the Critical Area Commission was consulted as to the best course of action.  When Mary Owens could not make the determination, the problem was forwarded to the county agency responsible for creating the initial data.  In most cases the hard copy critical area boundary line maps did not make accurate distinctions between tidal wetlands and the critical area boundaries.  In these instances, the 1972 State wetland maps originally used to determine the critical area boundary line were also compared to the data files.  When the distinctions were not accurate, corrections were made to the data files using the best fit between the 19872 State wetland maps and the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) wetlands data files.  When all edits were complete the data was built and cleaned (using ARC/INFO version 8.0) to meet MD DNR 1-24,000 scale standards.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The final process was to perform quality control and to prepare the critical area data for distribution.  The Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (CBCAC) staff performed the task of checking the data for quality and accuracy.  The critical area data was imported into a Micro Images format (using TNT MIPS version 6.4) and warped to MD State Plane 1983 (NAD1983) with units in meters.  The data was then put into MERLIN on line (Maryland’s Environmental Resource and Land Information Network - www.mdmerlin.net) system where the CBCAC would have access.  Once the CBCAC did their quality control of the data, all needed edits were referred back to MD DNR/GIS for correction.  All corrections were made and data was once again built and cleaned (using ARC/INFO version 8.0) to meet MD DNR 1-24,000 scale standards.
