  Description:
    Abstract:
      In 2000, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) was awarded a Coastal Zone
      Management grant to complete the acquisition of a recent (ca. 1990) digital shoreline for the coastal
      regions of Maryland - the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries, the coastal bays, and the Atlantic Coast.
      MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI) of Gaithersburg, Md., to extract
      shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of
      3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs).  In areas where a wetland coverage was not
      yet available, EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography.   DOQQ registration
      (Maryland State Plane Coordinate System, NAD 83, meters) was transferred automatically to the
      shoreline vectors.  Following shoreline extraction or interpretation, EDI assigned attributes to the
      vectors based on shoreline type: beach, vegetated, structure, or water's edge.

      This data set has been merged into a county files for ease of processing and decision making.
    Purpose:
      This data set complements a set of historical digital shorelines for the Maryland reaches
      of the Chesapeake Bay, the coastal bays, and the Atlantic coast.  That data set spans the period
      1841-1977.  The two data sets will be used to update a series of Shoreline Changes maps and to
      determine coastal land loss, by watershed and by county, during the last half of the 20th century.
      Other State agencies will be able to use this data to analyze and update land loss information,
      analyze historical erosion trends, and assess the extent and magnitude of shore erosion on a regional
      geographic basis.  In particular, the availability of up-to-date shoreline change data will support the
      design and implementation of shore protection projects and the development of a comprehensive shore
      erosion control plan.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Attribute accuracy was not assessed.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    EDI checked logical consistency through a series of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC)
    procedures, reported in the Process Steps (interpretation/extraction of shorelines).
  Completeness_Report:
    The area covered includes the Maryland part of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries, the
    coastal bays, and the Atlantic coast of the State.  The only exclusions were (1) the headward reach of
    the Patapsco River west of the Curtis Bay quadrangle and (2) shorelines located in out-of-state areas,
    such as the Virginia side of the Potomac River.

    In digitizing historical shorelines from hard copy maps, MGS had adopted an operational definition of
    the headward extent of a stream - the point at which the stream was represented on the map by a single
    line versus a double line delineating opposite stream banks.  That point, dependent as it is on the scale
    of the map, does not necessarily represent the head of tide.  A similar criterion was used in extracting
    the 1990 shoreline to the extent that the contractor could fit a double line on photography displayed
    at a scale of 1:24,000.  Reaches upstream of that point were excluded.  Again, the headward extent
    of a digitized stream does not necessarily correspond with head of tide.

    Shorelines in the 1990 data set bounded several different wetlands classifications (Cowardin et al.,
    1979):
    1.  E 1 UB L (Estuarine -- Subtidal -- Unconsolidated bottom -- Subtidal)
    2.  E 2 US M (Estuarine   Intertidal   Unconsolidated shore   Irregularly exposed)
    3.  E 2 US N (Estuarine   Intertidal   Unconsolidated shore   Regularly flooded)
    4.  E 2 US P (Estuarine   Intertidal   Unconsolidated shore   Irregularly flooded)
    5.  M 2 US M (Marine   Intertidal   Unconsolidated shore   Irregularly exposed)
    6.  M 2 US N (Marine   Intertidal   Unconsolidated shore   Regularly flooded)
    7.  R 1 UB V (Riverine -- Tidal -- Unconsolidated bottom -- Permanent tidal (tidally influenced, freshwater system)
    8.  R 2 UB 8   (Riverine -- Lower perennial -- Unconsolidated bottom -- Eusaline)
    In addition to designating UB L and UB V as water, M 2 or E 2 US (Unconsolidated shore) M
    (Irregularly flooded) or N (Regularly flooded) classifications were considered water, given that those
    areas were more likely to be under water than above.  E 2 US P (Irregularly flooded) was considered
    upland, given that those areas were more likely to be above water than under.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The DOQQs meet National Map Accuracy Standards at the production scale of 1:12,000, using the
        American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) method.  The contractor who
        produced the DOQQs provided a detailed aerotriangulation report for each production area (See
        DOQQ metadata at the web site listed in www.towson.edu/cgis/metadata).

        The production of accurately georeferenced DOQQs depends on sufficient ground control.  In open
        water, ground control is necessarily lacking, because land areas, if they exist at all, are small and/or
        inaccessible.  Two quarter quads in the data set, Deal Island NW and Barren Island NE, contain so
        much open water that they are not properly tied to the adjoining tiles, Nanticoke SW and Honga NW,
        respectively.  Consequently, corresponding line work (shoreline) had to be visually corrected to
        maintain consistency within the data set.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The aerial photography from which the DOQQs were developed was not tide-coordinated.
        Therefore, shorelines in this data set do not represent a consistent vertical datum.

        Most of the recent shorelines were extracted from the DNR wetlands inventory, a
        vector data set interpreted from the DOQQs.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Under contract to the Maryland Geological Survey, Earth Data International extracted or interpreted
        the modern (1988-1995) shoreline directly or indirectly from digital orthophotography.  For all but 35
        of the quarter quads, EDI extracted the shoreline from existing wetlands vectors, previously delineated
        for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) over 1:1,000-scale DOQQs.  The DOQQs,
        in turn, were derived from 1:40,000-scale color infrared (CIR) film.  For the remaining 35 quarter quads,
        the shoreline was interpreted directly from the DOQQs.

        For shoreline vectors extracted from the existing wetlands coverage, EDI stripped wetlands vectors of
        their linear attributes (line classes).  All shorelines and the DOQQ tile boundary were displayed over
        the DOQQ (raster) from which they were originally interpreted and reassigned attributes.  Shoreline
        segments were classified using the following four categories: beach, structure, vegetated, and water's
        edge.  All four categories are linear features, except for "beach," which can be both linear and
        polygonal.  The DOQQ tile boundary was arbitrarily assigned one of the four categories so that it could
        be extracted with the shoreline vectors.  Shoreline vectors were extracted from the original vector set
        by line class, using only the four shoreline categories.  The extracted vectors were then displayed to
        detect shoreline breaks or other consistencies.  Errors were corrected, and shoreline vectors were
        re-extracted.  After extraction, vector sets were cleaned by deleting any extraneous lines (non-shoreline
        vectors) that had been mistakenly assigned one of the four categories before extraction.  Beach
        polygons were attributed at this time, and the DOQQ tile boundary was assigned to a fifth category -
        unclassified.  The final quality control check consisted of two steps.  First, each tile (quarter quad) was
        displayed individually to check for unclassified shoreline vectors.  Second, if the photography on which
        the DOQQs were based was flown in the same year, vectors from adjacent tiles were merged into a
        single, 7.5-minute quadrangle vector set.  Otherwise, multi-year shorelines for the same quad were
        stored as separate objects within the TNTmips project (.rvc) file.  Merged vector sets were displayed
        to check for class consistency (proper edge matching) between adjacent tiles.  Any necessary
        corrections were made before saving the final vector sets.

        Shorelines derived directly from DOQQs were interpreted according to the procedure outlined in the
        wetlands inventory metadata.

        The DOQQs were already georeferenced to the Maryland State Plane Coordinate System (North
        American Datum of 1983, meters).  Georeferencing was transferred automatically upon delineating
        either wetlands or shorelines.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The first step in creating the state wide file was to add an attribute field to each database for the quadrangle name and the date of photography.  The name and date was added so as not to lose this information when the files were merged.  Also the topology of the quad files were changed from polygonal to linear in order to delete the surrounding neat lines.  Once the neat lines were removed, the (125) MGS shoreline files were merged into a state wide file.  Unfortunately, the final output of the merge left a file with numerous undershoots, dangles, and mismatches.  These features had to be manually cleaned using the native orthophotography and the DNR Wetlands.  In most cases, the undershoots in the linear features were between quadrangles.  Therefore, a cross connecting line was added and attributed accordingly.  Overshoots were deleted based upon user best judgment using the native orthophotography.  Mismatches were also shifted based upon the native orthophotography using operator best judgment.  Once all dangles, undershoots, and mismatches were corrected, the linear shoreline was validated for topology.

        The second step in creating the state wide file was to add the Maryland State Boundary to the linear shorelines.  The linear shorelines were merged with the most recent Political State Boundary.  Unfortunately, the final output of this merge also left a file with undershoots, dangles, and mismatches.  Undershoots were just a lack of connection between the linear shoreline and the State Boundary.  Therefore, across connector was added and attributed.  Dangles on the other hand were lines digitized from the orthophoto that extended outside the Political State Boundary.  These lines were closed and attributed as a cut off to digitizing effort.  And, an attribute field was added to describe to which state the linear feature belongs(Maryland, Delaware, Washington, or Virgin).  The State Wide file was once again validated for topology.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: In creating an inclusive shoreline file, the Department of Natural Resources added in the shoreline for the Susquehanna River up to the Conowingo Dam.  Just as the initial Recent shoreline data was created, the DNR wetlands and the 12,000 scale Digital Orthophotography was used to accomplish the task.  The linear shorelines were identified and extracted from the associated Wetlands(Aberdeen NE and NW, Conowingo Dam SW, SE, and NE, & Rising Sun SW).  The name and date was added.  The shorelines for Deer Creek and Octoraro Creek were included up to the nearest fish blockage(Dam) as well.  The file was then merged and manually cleaned using the same procedures discussed in process step 2.  All data was then validated for consistency.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The SwrecentSL file was split up into county wide data sets for ease of distribution.  Due to the size of the statewide shoreline data, the shoreline file will have to be cut down in order to necessitate downloading from the Department of Natural Resources data down load site.  The SWrecentSL data was intersected by the Political County boundary file using Arc Info's identification process.  This process gave the ability to select out the shoreline boundaries by their associated county placement.  The statewide shoreline file was then extracted out into county wide data sets.  Please see supplemental information for a list of county data set codes.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Shoreline vectors are grouped by 7.5-minute quad and, within a quad, by year.  Shorelines for a
      particular quad are located in a directory assigned the full, concatenated name of the quad.  The
      TNTmips project (.rvc) files, which contain the shoreline vectors, are named according to the following
      conventions.  The first four or five characters are an abbreviation of the quad name, usually the first four
      or five letters of the name.  The next three characters "_SL" indicate that the file contains shorelines.
      The file extension ".rvc" denotes a file that can be read by MicroImage's TNT line of products.  The
      TNTmips description of the project file is in the form:
      QUAD NAME (NE/NW/SE/SW) - Shoreline - 19xx, where
      QUAD NAME = the full name of the quad
      (NE/NW/SE/SW) = the quadrants for which a shoreline was interpreted
      19xx = the shoreline year
      For example, the shoreline for the Richland Point quad is located in a directory named RichlandPoint.
      The file that contains the shoreline vector itself is named RICHL_SL.rvc.  The TNTmips description of
      the file is "RICHLAND POINT (NE) - Shoreline - 1994," indicating that a 1994 shoreline was
      interpreted from the NE quadrant only of the Richland Point quad.

      Each .rvc file contains one or two "objects"   shoreline vectors for particular years.  Naming and
      describing objects also follow conventions.  The object name "_19xx" always indicates the shoreline
      year.  The object description gives the exact date on which the aerial photography from which the
      DOQQs were derived was flown.  For example, "1994 shoreline from DOQQs flown 4/8/1994".
      Line and polygon attribute tables, both named "TYPE," are associated with each object.  They contain
      the attributes described in Section 5.1.  A second table "TypeStyle" contains the style assignment for
      the TYPE Table.  TypeStyle points to another project file, ShoreStyles.rvc, which contains common
      line and polygon styles for the entire data set.
