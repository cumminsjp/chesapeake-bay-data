  Description:
    Abstract: In Maryland certain wetlands with rare, threatened, endangered species or unique habitat receive special attention.  The Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) Title 26, Subtitle 23, Chapter 06, Sections 01 & 02 identifies these Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) and affords them certain protections including a 100 foot buffer from development.  The Maryland Department of the Environment is responsible for identifying and regulating these wetlands.  In general, the US Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory wetlands provide the basis for identifying these special wetlands.  Additional information, determined from field inspections, is used to identify and classify these areas.
    Purpose: The Maryland Department of Natural Resources, as part of its natural resource management objectives, uses this WSSC data for site and regulatory application reviews, management plans and other uses.  In 1988-89, Maryland DNR (then responsible for identifying and protecting WSSC's) contracted with Salisbury State University to produce Wetlands Guidance maps that contained Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC).  Digital WSSC files were produced as part of that effort.  In 1997, with new WSSC's identified in COMAR, Maryland DNR began the process of creating an updated file and producing a new series of guidance maps.

  Data_Set_Credit: Lynn Davidson with DNR's Forest, Wildlife and Heritage unit provided the source material, provided guidance and performed the final quality control review.  Kevin Boone with DNR's Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service performed all data creation and correction functions.  The Maryland Department of the Environment's Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways Division established and maintains the official list of Wetlands of Special State Concern.
  Native_Data_Set_Environment: All data creation and quality control work was done on PC's running MS/DOS 6.22 and MicroImage Inc.'s MIPS 3.32 and NT Workstation version 4.0 using MicroImage Inc.'s TNTmips software versions 5.5 through 5.7.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Since this data set includes only one attribute (WSSC), there is little accuracy to report.  All polygons are attributed.  It is believed that all linear wetlands are attributed, but all line segments are not.  Line segments belonging to polygons are not
      attributed.
    Quantitative_Attribute_Accuracy_Assessment:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Value: Unknown
      Attribute_Accuracy_Explanation: There is no quantitative accuracy statement made.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Each WSSC is either a linear feature or a closed polygon.  Dangles and overshoots were removed if found.  There was no minimum WSSC area - all features on the source maps were created regardless of size.  All polygons were classed.  Final  verification was completed by visual inspection only.
  Completeness_Report: The existing WSSC data was updated using the individual hard copy maps depicting WSSC defined in current regulations.  After all updates were merged with the existing county files, each county file was visually inspected against the source maps for completeness.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The data is considered map accurate at a scale of 1::24,000.  Operator ""best judgement"" was used concerning the positional accuracy of manually generated WSSC features.  There were no definitive assessments made to determine a quantitative measure of the positional accuracy.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        In 1988-89, Maryland DNR contracted with Salisbury State University to produce Wetlands guidance maps that contained Wetlands of Special State Concern.  Digital WSSC files were produced as part of that effort.  No written documentation exists for that data set.  In 1997, DNR obtained updated WSSC data and began the process of updating the original data files.  The update process consisted of three distinct phases:: 1) making the original digital file (edition 1) match the Guidance Maps, 2) making corrections to the file to reflect current regulations, and 3) adding the new Critical Area nontidal WSSC's.
        Phase 1 was necessary because the digital files used to create the Guidance maps were not available.  An earlier, draft version was the only one available.  Those files were created in MicroImage Inc's DOS MIPS (RVF format) versions 3.30
        through  3.33.  Each file was in Maryland State Plane 1927 feet.  Each Guidance Map (7.5' quad size) was reviewed and the digital file (also 7.5' quad size) edited using MIPS 3.33 such that the linear and polygon WSSC features were as identical as possible between the two.  Wherever possible, the NWI wetlands polygons were used as the source for the WSSC.  In some cases, manual digitizing was required.  Only on-screen digitizing methods were employed and operator ""best judgement"" was used to determine the level of agreement between the map and the digital product.  At the end of this phase, each quad-sized digital file agreed with each Guidance Map.
        Phase 2 consisted of reviewing each Guidance Map for consistency with the current WSSC's as defined in regulation.  In some cases, the map was found to be in error.  Each quad-sized WSSC file (Maryland State Plane 1927 feet) was then edited using MicroImages Inc.'s DOS MIPS version 3.33 based on instructions from the reviewer.  At the end of this phase, each quad-sized digital file was consistent with the official WSSC list except for WSSC's within the Maryland's Critical Area (see the Critical Area data set and metadata).
        Phase 3 consisted of adding the Critical Area WSSC's to the digital files.  The DOS MIPS RVF files were imported into MicroImage Inc's TNTMIPS version 5.5 (the current version in use is 5.7 beta) and reprojected to Maryland State Plane 1983
        meters.  County-wide NWI file were used as the basis for delineating the new WSSC features, which were provided on photocopied copies of 7.5' quadrangle maps.  Wherever possible, the NWI wetlands polygons were used as the source for the WSSC.  In some cases, manual digitizing was required.  Only on-screen digitizing methods were employed and operator ""best judgement"" was used to determine the level of agreement between the map and the digital product.  All WSSC features from the county-sized file (containing the new WSSC's) and each quad-sized file (containing all the previous WSSC's) were extracted and placed in a new county-wide file.  These data were then visually inspected on-screen for consistency with all the WSSC source maps.  Any necessary corrections were made.  When completed, the county files were prepared for distribution.  The county files are distributed for the Maryland Technology Toolbox in Maryland State Plane 1983 meters.
