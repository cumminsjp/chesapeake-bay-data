  Description:
    Abstract: This file is a statewide digital watershed file. It was created primarily for state and federal agency use. The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p. 1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. Some watersheds drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area watershed were split to maintain a maximum size of 15,000 acres. The watershed boundaries in this file were developed in a joint state and federal effort to create a consistent watershed file for use by all government agencies with an interest in Maryland's watersheds. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) redefined the third order watersheds creating the HUA14 file. This file contains all of the HUA14 watersheds and some added watersheds to maintain water quality sampling sites. It was also used to create the Maryland Sub-Watershed file.
    Purpose: This file was created to identify and define third order watershed from contours on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. In addition to identifying Strahler third order streams it was necessary to separate certain streams to ensure their association with a proper receiving body of water. Some watersheds were split to maintain the size of watershed areas for state planning purposes. It was intended to maintain a unique watershed number in both this file and HUA14 so that state and federal agencies would have a consistent code for reference. This file has both the federal codes and the state codes for cross referencing. Most of the watersheds in this file are the same as the watershed boundaries in the federal file HUA14. There is one difference in the watershed files. This file has a buffered shoreline added to separate the Chesapeake Bay from land. The parent federal file HUA14 identifies watersheds by the federal Hydrologic Unit Code (HUA or HUC code) while the state file uses the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) watershed codes.
    Supplemental_Information: See Maryland's Sub-Watershed which is an 8-digit watershed file and its metadata.  The State political boundary in this file is used for all Statewide files created by the Geographic Information Services Division of MD DNR.  HUA14 Watershed codes are in the file. MDE collects data to the MDE8DIGT code.  MD DNR maintains data for the 10 Tributary Strategy Watersheds in the  STRACODE and STRANAME field.  This file is derived from SHED1998.

  Data_Set_Credit: The original eight digit watershed file was created in 1991 from Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) hardcopy watershed maps. The Maryland Office of Planning (OP) created that digital file by contracting with Daft, McCune and Walker to digitize third order stream watersheds. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) produced the Hydrological Unit Code watershed file HUA14 using the OP file as a base map and redefining watersheds. NCRS field offices verified the watershed boundaries. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development Maryland Historic Trust (MHT) provided scanned US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets to be used as a base map for corrections. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) corrected the watershed boundaries to the scanned USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets in cooperation with NRCS. The State political boundary file from Maryland State Highway Administration's (SHA) GRID map series was merged into the file replacing the existing state line. The merge and watershed corrections were completed by DNR.
  Native_Data_Set_Environment:
    The data creation and oringinal quality control work was done on Inetl Based PC's running MS/DOS and NT Workstation using software packages by ESRI such as ARC/INFO, ARC/VIEW and MicroImage Inc.'s TNTMIPS.

    The original digital file was created in workstation ESRI software ARC/INFO version unknown. The U.S.  Natural Resources Conservation Service edited the file in GRASS version unknown. MD DNR edited the file in TNTMIPS, PC ARC/INFO 3.5 . MD DNR will maintain the file in ESRI Shapefile  formats, and TNTMIPS '.rvc' format.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: There are no blank fields for any of the polygons. The fields AREA, PERIMETER, SWSH987F_, SWSH987F_I, MAJOR1, MINOR1,  X_COORD and Y_COORD are internal fields to PC ARC/INFO. The MDE6DIGT, MDE8DIGT, HUA8, HUA11, and HUA14 fields were filled by intersecting appropriate files with SHED1998. ACRE and DNR12DIG fields were filled by mathematical calculation. MDE6NAME and MDE8NAME were filled by joining appropriate data bases. The SHEDNUM, WHOLE, MARYLAND, LAND, DC, STRACODE, STRANAME and STFIPS fields were filled by visual interpretation. The CNTYFIPS and CO fields were filled by intersection and manually combining data when necessary.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Each watershed is a closed polygon. Each polygon has a centroid created by PC ARC/INFO where the attribute is attached. Extra nodes and label points have been removed. Polygons were checked and all of the polygons are essential to meet the decision rules set for creation of the file. Dangles and overshoots have been removed. Final verification was completed by creating a dBASE III+ report of all polygons by area.
  Completeness_Report:
    All land areas in the State of Maryland and Washington D.C. have watersheds defined. Watersheds that join or are contiguous to Maryland will be defined by adjoining states through an effort coordinated by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). At this time, Pennsylvania and Virginia have completed most of the adjoining watersheds. SHED1998 watersheds are delineated for all third order streams, as defined by Strahler and visible on USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. Watersheds were delineated to ensure that all land areas drain to the proper receiving body. The delineated area needs to be less than 15,000 acres. If the area exceeds 15,000 acres, an hydrologically correct split has been defined. Watersheds exceeding this acreage exist because no hydrological split could be defined. Watershed lines must continue into adjoining states. Watersheds were verified over scanned USGS Quad sheets and all lines were checked. Any line that did not follow hydrologic contours was corrected. All watersheds were clipped to the State Highway Administation (SHA) 24,000 political boundary file.

    The other decision rules for watersheds are as
    follows:
    -	Watersheds were delineated to ensure that all land areas
    drain to the proper receiving body;
    -	The delineated area needs to be less than 15,000 acres;
    -	If the area exceeds 15,000 acres, a hydrologically correct
    split has been defined;
    -	Watersheds exceeding this acreage exist because no
    hydrological split could be defined;
    -	MDE watershed codes must be maintained: and
    -	Watershed lines must continue into adjoining states.
    Watersheds were verified over scanned USGS Quad sheets and all
    lines were checked.  Any line that did not follow hydrologic contours was
    corrected.  All watersheds were clipped to the State
    Highway Administration (SHA) 1:24,000 political boundary file.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Data were compiled on a 24,000 scale base using USGS 7.5 minute quads. Qualified hydrologic-engineers made inspections. Adjustments were based on 'Best professional Judgment' using quadrangle maps. Corrections reviewed by NRCS personnel and verified by field personnel.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: There is no vertical data reference.

      Process_Date: 1960
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Creation of digital Maryland watershed file (SWSHED) - MOP - Process - manual cartographic interpretation. The Watersheds in both maps were for groupings of large rivers. These groupings were hydrologically correct but not the same. Daft, McCune and Walker, working under contract with the Maryland Office of Planning (OP), digitized the MDE Watershed maps. The contract specified delineation of Watersheds for third order streams using hard copy USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets as a basis for contour lines. This file was completed in 1994. OP is the custodian of this original digital Watershed file. Projection State Plane 27 feet.

      Process_Description: Combining Maryland and Federal watersheds to create a digital file - NRCS - Process - digitization from hard copy maps into ARC/INFO. This file defines third order Watersheds correctly, although it has tidal areas that were too large to use in Watershed planning. State and federal agencies formed a work group to define Watersheds of consistent size for planning purposes. The NRCS was given directions to define smaller Watersheds and create a digital file. NRCS added the line work to the Maryland file over USGS quad sheets. Projection converted to UTM zone 17 meters.

      Process_Description: QC digital watershed file - DNR - Process - digitization from hard copy maps into GRASS. QC was done on this file over USGS quad sheets and it was determined that some of the lines were not quad accurate. DNR reviewed each of the Watersheds and coordinated with NRCS to make the changes; projection converted to State Plane 27 feet;
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Create digital file DNRHUA14 - DNR - process: on screen review over scanned USGS 7.5 minute quad sheets in Micro Images, Inc. TNTMIPS.  This file had no attributes. A unique four digit number was added to each polygon for identification. Each member of the work group was given this file (DNRHUA14) as a beta release with hopes that no new Watershed would need to be defined; projection State Plane 27 feet.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Attribute DNRHUA14 - DNR - process: create a field and fill with a unique number. This was done in ARC/INFO. DNR began attributing the file DNRHUA14 with MDE codes. Pennsylvania and Virginia began digitizing Watersheds for their state. They used DNRHUA14 to edge match between states. Some of the Watersheds could be better defined using elevation from the adjoining state. Some of the MDE codes could not be maintained because lines were missing; projection State Plane 27 feet.  Process was visual interpretation.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Add lines to maintain MDE codes and to be consistent with adjoining states - DNR - process: visual interpretation. DNR coordinated with NRCS to add the appropriate lines from other states. NRCS does not maintain all-water polygons (Maryland does) so it was necessary to create two files: one with the all-water Watersheds (SHED1997) and one without (HUA14). DNR discovered that the state line in DNRHUA14 was a 250,000 scale line that had an error. DNR removed this line and merged in the State Highway Administration (SHA) 24,000 scale state line. DNR completed the line work that would be maintained in the federal file and sent the file to NRCS for QC review. Exported file to DLG format in UTM zone 17. DNR completed the line work that would be maintained by Maryland; projection DNR's file State Plane 27 feet, NRCS's file UTM zone 17 meters.

        This field contains the Maryland Department of Environment (MDE) six digit Watershed code representing nineteen Watersheds for Maryland. This field was filled manually by DNR using Watershed codes in the original Watershed file from the Maryland Office of Planning (OP) and from hardcopy maps of the Watershed from MDE and directions given by MDE staff.

        This field also contains the MDE eight digit Watershed code representing one hundred thirty eight Watershed for Maryland. This field was filled by intersecting the old Watershed polygon code from OP then visually comparing attributes to hard copy maps and OP stream file.
