  Description:
    Abstract:
      This file (SWSUB8) is a statewide digital watershed file. This file depicts the State with 138 separate watersheds each with an 8-digit numeric code This file was created primarily for State and Federal agency use.  The creation of this file  goes back many years and involved several State and Federal agencies,.  This file was derived from a more detailed watershed file (Maryland's Third-Order Watershed).  The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) redefined the third order watersheds creating the HUA14 file.  The SUB1998 file contains all of the HUA14 Watersheds and some added Watersheds to maintain water quality sampling sites

      The process used to create this file is consistent with the elevation contour information found on the US Geological Survey's 7.5' topographic quadrangle maps and the Maryland Department of the Environment's watershed location and naming conventions.  This file is similar, but not identical, to the US Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC11) watershed file.

      The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p.1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets.  Some watershed drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area Watersheds were split to maintain a maximum size of 15,000 acres.
    Purpose:
      The watershed file is used by many state and local government agencies to accurately locate and report many landscape activities by watershed in Maryland.

      SWSUB8 was created to identify and define Sub-Watersheds from contours on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets.  This file was created from SHED1998 - currently being distributed under the name SWSHED12 -  by dissolving to the third-order-watershed codes.
    Supplemental_Information:
      This data can be found in 'Boundary\Watersheds\8Digit\swsub' folder on coverags.

      See Maryland's Third Order Watershed file and metadata as well.  That file (SWSHED12-Maryland'sThirdOrderWatershed) can be accessed at http://dnrweb.dnr.state.md.us/gis/data/

      The State political boundary used in this file is used for all Statewide files created by the Geographic Information Services Division of MD DNR.  HUA14 Watershed codes are in the file.  MDE collects data to the MDE8DIGT code.  MD DNR maintains data for the 10 Tributary Strategy Watersheds in the  STRACODE and STRANAME field.  This currnet file is derived from SHED1998, an older name for the current file, SWSHED12.

  Data_Set_Credit: The original eight digit watershed file was created in 1991 from Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) hardcopy watershed maps. The Maryland Department of Planning (MDP) created that digital file by contracting with Daft, McCune and Walker to digitize third order stream watersheds. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) produced the Hydrological Unit Code watershed file HUA14 using the MDP file as a base map and redefining watersheds. NCRS field offices verified the watershed boundaries. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development Maryland Historic Trust (MHT) provided scanned US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets to be used as a base map for corrections. MD DNR corrected the watershed boundaries to the scanned USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets in cooperation with NRCS. The State political boundary file from Maryland State Highway Administration's (SHA) GRID map series was merged into the file replacing the existing state line. The merge and watershed corrections were completed by MD DNR.
  Native_Data_Set_Environment:
    The data creation and oringinal quality control work was done on Inetl Based PC's running MS/DOS and NT Workstation using software packages by ESRI such as ARC/INFO, ARC/VIEW and MicroImage Inc.'s TNTMIPS.

    The original digital file was created in workstation ESRI software ARC/INFO version unknown. The U.S.  Natural Resources Conservation Service edited the file in GRASS version unknown. MD DNR edited the file in TNTMIPS, PC ARC/INFO 3.5 . MD DNR will maintain the file in ESRI Shapefile  formats, and TNTMIPS '.rvc' format.
Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: There are no blank fields for any of the polygons.  The fields AREA, PERIMETER, SWSUBIdc_, SWSUBSdc_id, X_COORD and Y_COORD are internal fields to PC ARC/INFO.  The MDE6DIGT, MDE8DIGT.  ACRE were  filled by mathematical calculation.  MDE6NAME and MDE8NAME were filled by joining appropriate databases. Each polygon was checked for accuracy both through automated and manual inspection. The data is complete and accurate. Each of these fields were created by one analyst and reviewed by another using automated and visual inspection.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Each watershed is a closed polygon. Each polygon has a centroid created by PC ARC/INFO where the attribute is attached. Extra nodes and label points have been removed. Polygons were checked and all of the polygons are essential to meet the decision rules set for creation of the file. Dangles and overshoots have been removed. Final verification was completed by creating a dBASE III+ report of all polygons by area.
  Completeness_Report: All land areas in the State of Maryland and Washington D.C. have watersheds defined. Watersheds that join or are contiguous to Maryland will be defined by adjoining states through an effort coordinated by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). At this time, Pennsylvania and Virginia have completed most of the adjoining watersheds. Watersheds are delineated for all third order streams, as defined by Strahler and visible on USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Data were compiled on a 1:24,000 scale base using USGS 7.5 minute quads.  Qualified hydrologic -engineers made inspections.  Adjustments were based on 'Best professional Judgment' using quadrangle maps.  Corrections were reviewed by NRCS personnel and verified by field personnel.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: There is no vertical data reference.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Creation of hardcopy  of Maryland watershed maps for planning - MDE - 1960's  - Watershed maps were created from county topographic maps produced in the 1960's. These hardcopy maps were used by hydrologists and planners to create the first statewide Watershed maps. The Watersheds were attributed with a Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) 8 digit code. MDE is the custodian of these hard copy maps.
      Process_Date: 1960
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Creation of hardcopy of Federal watershed maps for planning - NRCS - 1960's - Process - manual cartographic interpretation. During this era the U.S. Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) created hardcopy Watershed 100,000 scale state wide map attributed with the Hydrologic Unit Code (HUA or HUC).
      Process_Date: 1960
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Creation of digital Maryland watershed file (SWSHED) - MDP - Process - manual cartographic interpretation. The Watersheds in both maps were for groupings of large rivers. These groupings were hydrologically correct but not the same. Daft, McCune and Walker, working under contract with the Maryland Deparment of Planning (MDP), digitized the MDE Watershed maps. The contract specified delineation of Watersheds for third order streams using hard copy USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets as a basis for contour lines. This file was completed in 1994. OP is the custodian of this original digital Watershed file. Projection State Plane 27 feet.
      Process_Date: 1994
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Combining Maryland and Federal watersheds to create a digital file - NRCS - Process - digitization from hard copy maps into ARC/INFO. This file defines third order Watersheds correctly, although it has tidal areas that were too large to use in Watershed planning. State and federal agencies formed a work group to define Watersheds of consistent size for planning purposes. The NRCS was given directions to define smaller Watersheds and create a digital file. NRCS added the line work to the Maryland file over USGS quad sheets. Projection converted to UTM zone 17 meters.
      Process_Date: 1995
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: QC digital watershed file - DNR - Process - digitization from hard copy maps into GRASS. QC was done on this file over USGS quad sheets and it was determined that some of the lines were not quad accurate. DNR reviewed each of the Watersheds and coordinated with NRCS to make the changes; projection converted to State Plane 27 feet;
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Create digital file DNRHUA14 - DNR - process:: on screen review over scanned USGS 7.5 minute quad sheets in Micro Images, Inc. TNTMIPS.  This file had no attributes. A unique four digit number was added to each polygon for identification. Each member of the work group was given this file (DNRHUA14) as a beta release with hopes that no new Watershed would need to be defined; projection State Plane 27 feet;
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Attribute DNRHUA14 - DNR - process:: create a field and fill with a unique number. This was done in ARC/INFO. DNR began attributing the file DNRHUA14 with MDE codes. Pennsylvania and Virginia began digitizing Watersheds for their state. They used DNRHUA14 to edge match between states. Some of the Watersheds could be better defined using elevation from the adjoining state. Some of the MDE codes could not be maintained because lines were missing; projection State Plane 27 feet.  Process was visual interpretation.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Add lines to maintain MDE codes and to be consistent with adjoining states - DNR - process:: visual interpretation. DNR coordinated with NRCS to add the appropriate lines from other states. NRCS does not maintain all-water polygons (Maryland does) so it was necessary to create two files:: one with the all-water Watersheds (SHED1997) and one without (HUA14). DNR discovered that the state line in DNRHUA14 was a 250,000 scale line that had an error. DNR removed this line and merged in the State Highway Administration (SHA) 24,000 scale state line. DNR completed the line work that would be maintained in the federal file and sent the file to NRCS for QC review. Exported file to DLG format in UTM zone 17. DNR completed the line work that would be maintained by Maryland; projection DNR's file State Plane 27 feet, NRCS's file UTM zone 17 meters.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Create digital file SHED96A - DNR - Process was heads up digitizing in Micro Images Inc. TNTMIPS and attribution done in ARC/INFO. DNR released SUBS96A, a draft file. This file contained the MDE codes and the line work to be maintained by Maryland; projection State Plane 27 feet.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Remove dangles and overshoots in SHED96A - DNR - Users reported dangles and overshoots in the file. DNR cleaned the file. Process was done in ARC/INFO; projection State Plane 27 feet.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Create digital file SHED96B - DNR - DNR released SUBS96B, a draft file. This file is a cleaned version of the SUBS96A Watershed file. Projection State Plane 27 feet.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: QC SHED96A - NRCS - NRCS reviewed the line work and determined that the lines were generalized; projection UTM Zone 17 meters.  Process was to digitally compare the file to DNRHUA14 file in GRASS software package.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Correct the generalization of line work in SHED96A - NRCS - Process was to digitally compare the file to DNRHUA14 file in GRASS. NRCS re-digitized the lines (see event 8). NRCS digitized lines to be consistent with adjoining states and 250,000 scale state boundary; projection still UTM Zone 17 meters; digitizing - in GRASS.
      Process_Date: 1996
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Create digital files HUA14, HUA11, and HUA8 - NRCS - NRCS released HUA14 in a DLG format; projection UTM Zone 17 meters.

      Entity_Type_Definition:
        This field contains the Maryland Department of Environment (MDE) six digit Watershed code representing nineteen Watersheds for Maryland. This field was filled manually by DNR using Watershed codes in the original Watershed file from the Maryland Office of Planning (OP) and from hardcopy maps of the Watershed from MDE and directions given by MDE staff.

        This field also contains the MDE eight digit Watershed code representing one hundred thirty eight Watershed for Maryland. This field was filled by intersecting the old Watershed polygon code from OP then visually comparing attributes to hard copy maps and OP stream file.
