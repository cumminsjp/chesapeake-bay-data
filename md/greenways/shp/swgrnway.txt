  Description:
    Abstract: The Maryland Greenways Commission has been working since 1990 to plan, establish, and promote a statewide system of greenways.  Greenways are natural corridors set aside to connect larger areas of open space and to provide for the conservation of natural resources, protection of natural resources, protection of habitat, movement of plants and animals, and to offer opportunities for linear recreation, alternative transportation, and nature study.  In addition to Green Way Corridors, water routes know as Water Trails have been recognized as pathways for recreation and nature study.
    Purpose: This file is used for planning purposes and making maps. This file was used in making the maps for the Maryland Greenway Commission’s Maryland Atlas of Greenways, Water Trails, and Green Infrastructure 2000 edition.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Greenway lines are classed as either existing, potential or watertrail.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Greenway lines for each county were digitized.  Greenway Commission staff reviewed the maps produced to ensure all greenway corridors were correct.
  Completeness_Report: The greenway lines were reviewed by staff of the Greenway Commission and found to be suitable at the maps scale developed.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The greenway lines were created from small-scale (approximately 1:500,000 scale) maps and intended for use as a graphic only.  No horizontal accuracy is given beyond the use of a small-scale graphical element.
  Lineage:
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Greenway lines were digitized on-screen using the 1992 Maryland Greenway Atlas as a guide.  Maryland State Highway Administration road and stream files (1:24,000 scale) were used as reference layers.  Updates and new lines were created from verbal instructions (such as follow the railroad tracks from Route 50 to Baltimore & Annapolis Boulevard).  Since the end-product was to be a graphical map for use in the new publication, the positional accuracy of lines was considered acceptable at scales of approximately 1:500,000.
