  Description:
    Abstract: The National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) is a network of protected areas established for long-term research, education and stewardship. This partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states protects more than one million acres of estuarine land and water, which provides essential habitat for wildlife; offers educational opportunities for students, teachers and the public; and serves as living laboratories for scientists.
    Purpose: Three of the National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR) Sites are located in Maryland.  They are: Otter Point Creek along the Bush River in Harford County, Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary in Anne Arundel and Prince George's Counties, and Monie bay in Somerset County.  The project area boundaries were created to assist in planning and data collection operations.

They were drawn by Ken Miller and verified by the Maryland Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) coordinator, Carol Towle.  Using the source maps as a rough guide, the lines were redrawn using an ArcView 3.2 platform.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Several process steps and data sets went into updating the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) boundaries since their original creation over the 10-meter panchromatic imagery.  First off, the Otter Point Creek and the Jug Bay sites were expanded to incorporate recent property acquisitions.  These boundaries, originally digitized over tax map boundaries for property acquisition assessment, were added.  Otter Point Creek had just a small expansion of a couple of parcels.  However, Jug Bay was expanded considerably to encompass the Glendening Preserve and some other properties to the east acquired by Anne Arundel County.  Now as per the requirements of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System Program each reserve was split up into what they designate as Core and Buffer Areas.  Areas designated as core being defined as areas of limited future disturbance that would affect the ecological integrity of the reserve.  Areas being designated as buffer as those areas that protect the core.  Therefore for the purpose of defining core and buffer for Maryland's Reserves, core will be those areas designated as open water, tidal wetlands, and non-tidal in holdings and buffer will be those areas designated as woodland and non-tidal wetlands.  For this the DNR 12,000 scale wetlands were intersected with the boundaries to delineate the tidal vs. non-tidal boundaries for Otter Point Creek and Jug Bay.  Note: in keeping with the separation of core and buffer non-tidal dikes and islands were removed from the core.  Now Monie Bay, being completely tidal in mature, had to be delineated using best user judgment.  And lastly, boundaries were separated by Maryland's Political County Boundaries to identify separations in ownerships.

Shorelines which did not correspond to property boundaries where modified to the MDOrthos0708 - MD Statewide Orthophotography 6 inch Natural Color.  In two instances parcels the where originally designated incorrectly were removed.  These include Somerset County, Map 0013 Parcel 25 and Anne Arundel County, Map 0071 Parcel 0065.  A parcel in Somerset County Map 0021 Parcel 0049 was added. It was incorrectly excluded in earlier file.
