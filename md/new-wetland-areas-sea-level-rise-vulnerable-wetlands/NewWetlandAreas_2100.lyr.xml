			<abstract>In the Chesapeake Bay relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate.  Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone.  Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City.</abstract>
			<purpose>The New Wetland Areas dataset is a derivative of the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) that identified present areas of Undeveloped Dry Land (UDL) likely to change to wetlands with wetland migration by year 2100.  These areas were extracted bor visualization and analysis purposes.  SLAMM uses Elevation, accumulations of sediments, wetland accretion and erosion rates, and sea level rise to predicatively model long-term wetland and shoreline change. In Maryland, SLAMM was run using the best available science, including sea level rise rate identified at 3.4 feet by year 2100, identified by the Maryland Commission on Climate Change.  The resulting changes to coastal marshes and shorelines can be visualized in their current state, 2050 and 2100 year scenarios.  To learn more about SLAMM please refer to Warren Pinnacle Consulting, Inc. http://www.warrenpinnacle.com/prof/SLAMM/SLAMM_Model_Overview.html</purpose>
			<supplinf>Three primary datasets were used in Maryland's SLAMM study, in addition to county LIDAR, these included the National Wetland Inventory (Publications 1977-2002), National Land Cover of Percent Impervious Surface (Publicationt 2001-2003) and National Hydrology Data (1999).  National Wetland Inventory (NWI) digital data files are records of wetlands location and classification as developed by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. The classification system was adopted as a national classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and wetlands attributes. The NWI input data used for this study was originally modified by the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) and Warren Pinnacle Consulting, Inc. for SLAMM version 5 study, Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Habitats in the Chesapeake Bay Region, and clipped to the individual Maryland county extents. One of the primary goals of the project was to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution.  The NLCD Impervious input data for the model was modified per the SLAMM version 5 NWF study of Maryland Chesapeake Bay region and clipped to the individual Maryland county extents. The NHD was used to determine Diked areas which had a vertical threshold (2 meters) applied to each.

			<attraccr>LIDAR:
There are four (4) attributes in the Bare Earth Mass Points files, representing the horizontal coordinates (easting &amp;
northing) and vertical position observed and vertical assigned (see process description).  Random inspections were made
to assure that each line in the file contained 4 values.

NHD:
Statements of attribute accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey Digital Line Graph (DLG) data, which is estimated to be 98.5 percent. One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy:  manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen.</attraccr>
		</attracc>
		<logic>Computational Consulting Services, the LIDAR processing vendor used proprietary algorithms to remove features and
artifacts in the First and Last Return data that did not reflect true ground elevation.  Subsequent quality assurance
testing by Dewberry determined that the data met FEMA and MD DNR specifications for both vertical accuracy and other consistencies with accepted standards.  The QA report can be accessed at http://dnrweb.dnr.state.md.us/gis/data/lidar.</logic>
		<complete>Spatial Systems Associates performed various inspections of the data to ensure: that each file contained the points
located within that tile; that tiles were completely filled; that the point density per tile was within expected ranges,
and that the tiles were correctly named.</complete>

				<horizpar>The horizontal coordinate values were designed to meet NSSDA accuracy for data at 1:2400 scale.</horizpar>
			</horizpa>
			<vertacc>
				<vertaccr>The RMSE value of 14.3 cm at the 95% confidence level was determined by an independent accuracy assessment conducted by Dewberry LLC according to the contract specifications. These specifications followed FEMA Appendix A guidelines regarding assessing vertical accuracy.  For data accurate to within 18.5 cm RMSE, the guidelines recommended a minimum of 20 independent check points be located in each of 5 different land cover categories: Grass/Ground, High Grass/Crops, Brush/Low Trees, Forest, and Urban/Pavement.  A total of 125 points were used for the assessments.  These points were surveyed by a licensed land surveyor and provided a positional location and elevation with an accuracy that exceeded the predicted accuracy of the LIDAR data.  The entire accuracy reports can be found at http://dnrweb.dnr.state.md.us/gis/data/lidar.</vertaccr>

						<edomvds>Within SLAMM-produced maps, each 30x30 map pixel represents the dominant category of land cover for a given cell. Tabular output is more precise, taking into account the amount of each
wetland category in each cell. Based on the percentage Impervious from the National Land Cover Database (http://www.mrlc.gov/index.asp), developed land was identified within the model. After testing several "percent impervious" thresholds, dry land that was at least 25% impervious was
categorized as "developed dry land."

						<edomvds>Freshwater forested wetland dominated by bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) - swamp tupelo (Nyssa biflora), Pumpkin ash (Fraxinus profunda), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) may also add to the canopy structure.  Cypress swamp soils are highly saturated, poorly drained, and contain high levels of organic matter.  These are freshwater systems that maintain standing water that may be seasonally or tidally influenced.  A variety of shrubs may also be present, winterberry (Ilex verticillata), swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), and northern arrow-wood (Viburnum recognitum).  Like other wetland systems, cypress swamps help buffer uplands, control erosion and filter storm water runoff.  They also provide essential habitats for rare, threatened or endangered plant and animal species in Maryland, such as catchfly cutgrass (Leersia lenticularis), red bay (Persea palustris), southern twayblade (Listera australis), and Virginia least trillium (Trillium pusillum var. virginianum).  These swamps also provide habitat for species of crayfish, many reptiles and amphibians, including the State-listed carpenter frog. http://www.nwf.org/Global-Warming/Effects-on-Wildlife-and-Habitat/Estuaries-and-Coastal-Wetlands/Chesapeake-Bay.aspx</edomvds>

						<edomvd>Irregularly Flooded Marsh (brackish)</edomvd>
						<edomvds>Irregularly flooded estuarine inter-tidal emergent wetlands have lower salinity than salt marsh and are often brackish.  Representative plant species include saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), salt reed grass (Distichlis spicata), black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus), and short-form smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora).  These marshes make up the majority of the coastal marsh types in the region and provide food and habitat for many species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds.  They also support fish species such as rockfish, white perch, herring and shad.  They absorb excess nutrients and pollution, and anchor loose soils. http://www.nwf.org/Global-Warming/Effects-on-Wildlife-and-Habitat/Estuaries-and-Coastal-Wetlands/Chesapeake-Bay.aspx</edomvds>

		<overview>
			<eaover>Each attribute represents a wetland type or a physical near shore environment of theMaryland's Chesapeake and Bay Counties. The attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy printouts and/or symbolized display of the digital wetlands data on an interactive computer graphic system. In addition, quality control verification software (USFWS-NWI) tests the attributes against a master set of valid wetland attributes.</eaover>
