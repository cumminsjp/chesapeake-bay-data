  Description:
    Abstract: The Q3 Flood Data are derived from the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to the earth's surface using the geographic projection and the decimal degree coordinate system.  The specifications for the horizontal control of Q3 Flood Data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:24000.  This metadata makes a reference to 'Q3 Flood Data Specifications.'  This is available from FEMA at ftp://ftp.fema.gov/mscdata/q3spec.txt
    Purpose: The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act,  which 'requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated, or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards' (Section 2 (b) (4) of the 1973 Flood Disaster Protection Act).  In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood insurance coverage offered through the NFIP. Q3 Flood Data files convey certain key features from the existing hard copy FIRM.  Edge-matching errors, overlaps and deficiencies in coverage, and similar problems are not corrected during digitizing or post-processing.  The Q3 Flood Data files are intended to provide users with automated flood risk data that may be used to locate SFHAs.  More detailed information may be obtained from the paper FIRM.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The Q3 Flood Data are county wide vector files derived from FEMA FIRMs.  The attribute definitions may be found in the 'Q3 Flood Data Specifications'.  Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphic with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system.  Selected attributes that could not be visually verified were individually queried.  In addition, an ARC/INFO Arc Macro Language (AML) software program was applied to the data set to test the attributes against a master set of valid attributes for the specific data category and a complete set of valid attribute combinations.  (See also Entity Attribute Information.)
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Polygon and chain-node topology are present. Certain node-area-line relationships are collected or generated to   satisfy topological requirements.  Some of these requirements include the following: lines must begin and end at nodes, lines must connect to each other at nodes, lines do not extend through nodes, left and right areas are defined for each line segment and are consistent throughout the files, and the lines representing the limits of the file neatlines are free of gaps.  Tests of logical consistency were performed by ARC/INFO software modules.  Check plots were made to test for leaks in all internal polygons.
  Completeness_Report:
    Data completeness for Q3 Flood Data files reflects the content of the source graphic.  Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints.
    Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management.  Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analysis of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrologic and hydraulic analysis.  Both detailed and approximate analyses are employed. Generally, detailed analyses are used to generate flood risk data only for developed or developing areas of communities.  For undeveloped areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA uses approximate analyses to generate flood risk data.  Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile are studied.
    Q3 Flood Data may be derived from DFIRM-DLGs, from FIRM-DLGs, or from FIRMs digitized previously for emergency applications, or they may be newly created.  In Q3 Flood Data derived from older data sets, certain items may not have been captured or may have been captured differently from the current Q3 Flood Data specifications.
    In some cases, preliminary FIRM data have been included in the Q3 Flood Data files.  These data have been provided to the community for review and comment, and may be subject to change before their final publication date.  In addition, in some cases, areas designated as Flood Prone Areas on maps prepared by USGS and FIA have been included in the Q3 Flood Data files.  These areas were delineated based on available information of past floods and are described by a unique attribute code that distinguishes them from areas of 1% annual chance flooding derived from FIRMs.
    FIRMs continually undergo revisions and updates.  Some of these revisions are effected by letter (Letter of Map Revision [LOMR], Letter of Map Amendment [LOMA]).  Q3 Flood Data may not reflect the most current information or information that is not mappable at the publication scale of the FIRM.  To obtain the latest information, contact the address listed under distributor.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Specifications for the digitizing of FIRMs to create Q3 Flood Data are consistent with those requirements for mapping at a scale of 1:24000. Horizontal control of Q3 Flood Data was established using USGS quadrangle maps at 1:24000 or other standard scales.  Users should assess the horizontal positional accuracy of the Q3 Flood Data with regard to the selected base map sources and the requirements of their application.  With increased frequency,  large-scale spatial data sets are becoming widely available for computer-based geographic information systems.  Q3 Flood Data may be used in combination with other digital spatial data; however, users should be aware that scalar  enlargements do not enhance the relative accuracy of the Q3 Flood Data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Q3 Flood Data were produced by either scanning and
        vectorizing or manually digitizing a hardcopy version of the graphic
        materials.  The scanning and vectorization process captured the digital
        data as raster data that were vectorized and attributed on an
        interactive editing station.  The manual digitizing process used a
        digitizing table to capture the digital data; attribution was performed
        either as the data were digitized or on an interactive edit station after
        the digitizing was completed.  The determination of the production methodology
        was based on various criteria, including availability of production systems.
        Four to nine control points per FIRM panel were used for registration
        during manual digitizing.  A projective   transformation was performed
        on the coordinates used in the data collection and editing systems to
        register the digital data to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
        grid coordinates.  An ARC/INFO coverage of the Q3 Flood Data was
        generated and used to create the Q3-DLG file.  The Q3 Flood
        Data were checked for position and attribute accuracy by comparing
        plots of the digital data to the source graphic and by symbolized
        display on an interactive computer system.  Selected attributes that
        could not be visually verified were individually queried. In addition,
        an ARC/INFO  Arc Macro Language (AML) software program was applied to
        the dataset to test the attributes against a master set of valid attributes
        for the specific data category and a complete set of valid attribute
        combinations.  Source graphics were revised to reflect updates
        effected by Letters of Map Change (Letter of Map Revision [LOMR],
        Letter of Map Amendment [LOMA]).  These revisions were included in
        the Q3 Flood Data if they were mappable at the publication scale of
        the source graphic.  Once final, the ARC/INFO coverage is projected into a
        geographic grid system, using decimal degree latitude and longitude
        coordinates and then converted into an ARC/INFO Export file.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The original files from FEMA were in ARC/INFO Format with Geographic Projection and decimal degrees units. These files have gone through two conversion processes at Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  These were converted to ARC/INFO export format using PC ARC/INFO.  At this point the projections were also changed. The projections were changed to Maryland State Plane NAD 1927 feet.  Subsequently these '.e00' files were converted to the ARCVIEW Shape files in Maryland State Plane NAD 1983 Meters.  The conversions are done on Intel compatible PCs running ESRI's ARCVIEW, ARC/INFO and Microimages Inc.'s TNTMIPS GIS software on the Windows NT platform.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      In addition to locational and topological information, Q3 coverage data elements are explicitly encoded using attribute items.  Each attribute item identifies characteristics about the Flood Hazard Area, COBRA, Floodway, Political Jurisdiction, Quadrangle, or FIRM panel.  All polygon data elements may be encoded with one or more feature characteristics.

      To display the 100 year and 500 year floodplains refer to the  'Enumerated Domain Values and their definitions' for the 'Attribute_Label: Zone' in the 'Attribute' section above.  This section details the attribute values to be selected for displaying the 100 and 500 year floodplains.

      The original data received from FEMA had 21 attributes in entity.  However, the data being distributed has 10 attributes (the attributes such as area, perimeter, ID number are not shown).  The ten attributes of the data being distribute are described in this section.  For the 21 attributes of the original data please visit the FEMA website at www.fema.gov. More specifically, for Q3 users guide visit ftp://ftp.fema.gov/mscdata/nuser_gd.txt, or for Q3 specifications, visit ftp://ftp.fema.gov/mscdata/q3spec.txt
    Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation: The FEMA 'Q3 Flood Data Specifications' contains a detailed description of each attribute code and a reference to other relevant information. Visit ftp://ftp.fema.gov/mscdata/q3spec.txt for this document.
