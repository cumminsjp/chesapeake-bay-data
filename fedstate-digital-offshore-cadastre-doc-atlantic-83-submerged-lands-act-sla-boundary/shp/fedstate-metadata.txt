  Description:
    Abstract: Areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) within Federal jurisdiction, and associated data the Minerals Management Service (MMS) uses to develop an offshore cadastre (OCS blocks).  An official baseline is established and used to generate the Submerged Lands Act (SLA) Boundary and Limit of '8(g) Zone'.  Other boundaries and lines (Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), international maritime, marine sanctuaries and national park) may also be included where these are appropriate and known.
    Purpose: Official Protraction Diagrams (OPD's) and associated boundaries and areas are generated in accordance with 30 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 256.8 to support Federal land ownership and mineral resource management.

          Access_Instructions: Files are available via anonymous ftp from ommgis.mrm.mms.gov.  Go to the mapping/atlantic83 subdirectory and download the at83fs.tar.Z file in binary mode. The downloaded file will need to be uncompressed and then unarchived.  In a UNIX environment use 'uncompress at83fs.tar.Z' and then 'tar xvf at83fs.tar'.  In a DOS environment use 'gzip -d filename' and then 'tar -xvf filename'.  The resulting two files will be a metadata file, mdat83fs.txt, (this file) and the Arc/Info export data file, fedstate.e00.  The gzip.exe and tar.exe utility programs may be obtained from http://ftp.uni-mannheim.de/systems/msdos/tools/.
