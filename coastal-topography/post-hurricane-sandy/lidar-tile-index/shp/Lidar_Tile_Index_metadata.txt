    Description:
      Abstract: This data represents the tile index for lidar data collected for the U.S. Geological Survey in November 2012 following Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in the eastern United States on October 29th, 2012. The lidar LAS and derived-digital elevation model (DEM) data are divided into these tiles and filenames match the tile number. The index shows the extent of data collection (portions of the coastline of New York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina) and provides tile names to aid in identifying files for data download.
      Purpose: The purpose of this project was to derive shoreline, dune crest (Dhigh), and dune toe (Dlow) of a portion of the New York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina coastlines, post-Hurricane Sandy (October 2012 hurricane), for use as a management tool and to make these data available to natural-resource managers and research scientists.
      Supplemental_Information: The tile index follows U.S. National Grid (USSNG) reference map. More information on the USNG can be found here: http://www.fgdc.gov/usng
