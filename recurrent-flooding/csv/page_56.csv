Virginia are given broad powers to protect the public health and welfare at Va. Code § 15.2-
1200. Counties are given general zoning authority at Virginia Code § 15.2-2280 and specific
authority to use zoning to “facilitate the provision of adequate...flood protection...” [§ 15.2-
2283 (iv)]. These local government zoning authorities have great potential for controlling
"development and redevelopment in high risk inundation zones, sending proper risk signals"
about shoreline development in the face of increased inundation risk due to sea level rise.
Localities have zoning and building code authorities granted to them by state and federal
statutes as well that can be used in flooding/sea level rise adaptation strategies. The
Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (Va. Code §10.1-2100/9VAC10-20) provides local
governments with tidal shorelines a number of land use authorities including “overlay districts”
along the shoreline within which development and redevelopment is restricted to protect
water quality. Local ordinances implement this statute and while there is a range of
"approaches, most localities require oversight and approval of any land disturbance"
"(development/redevelopment) in the “Resource Protection Area,” a zone extending 100 feet"
shoreward of the upper limits of the tidal wetlands.
A significant part of the Federal Emergency Management Administration’s (FEMA) National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) are floodplain ordinances necessary to implement local
floodplain management plans. FEMA requires local government floodplain zoning and building
code requirements (42 U.S.C. § 4001/ 44 CFR § 60.1) as a mandatory requirement prior to any
locality receiving federal flood insurance. This authority is overseen in Virginia by the
Department of Conservation and Recreation’s (DCR) floodplain management program (Va. Code
"§ 10.1-602), which suggests minimum local ordinances required to meet the FEMA/DCR"
requirements.
Floodplain management plans reach to local government ordinances and can require
"“freeboard,” a requirement that living space in a structure be at least a certain height above"
“base flood elevation” or the level of flooding expected from a once in 100-year flood.
"Currently in Virginia, there are at least 107 communities with 1- foot freeboards, which is"
"almost 40%. Seven communities have a 1.5-foot freeboard, four have a 2-foot freeboard, and"
four have 3-foot freeboard.
"Virginia, like most coastal states, has regulatory programs to protect its coastal and tidal"
estuarine ecosystem. Much river and tidal estuarine bottomland is state owned and
disturbance requires a permit from the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Development
"and redevelopment impacting mudflats, non-vegetated wetlands, and vegetated intertidal"
wetlands require a permit from federal regulators and state regulatory bodies. State authority
for wetlands protection is found at (9 VAC 25-210 /Va. Code §§ 62.1-44.15 and 62.1-44.15:20).
"For tidal wetlands, the primary state authority is given to the Virginia Marine Resources"
