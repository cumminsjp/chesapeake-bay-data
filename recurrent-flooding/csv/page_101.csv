Hampton Roads
Hampton Roads includes a large number of localities which vary greatly in both elevation and
"extent of development. Norfolk, Newport News, Portsmouth, Poquoson and Hampton are"
"highly developed localities, with extensive commercial and industrial development in Norfolk"
and Newport News. Virginia Beach and Chesapeake have both highly developed and pristine
areas. The remaining localities are considered less developed.
"Poquoson is considered highly vulnerable to sea level rise due to its elevation, which is entirely"
below 10-ft. Hampton and Norfolk both have substantial lands below the 10-ft elevation. Both
"Virginia Beach and Chesapeake have low land, vulnerable to sea level rise, but elevations are"
"higher in their most developed areas. Erosion is a threat, particularly along the oceanfront."
"The southern shore of the James River has high bluffs along much of its length, buffering the"
"effects of flooding from sea level rise, but still vulnerable to erosion. The northern shore tends"
to be lower elevation and flooding has been an issue as far up as Jamestown Island.
Middle Peninsula
Gloucester and Mathews counties have most of the low lying land in the Middle Peninsula
"region, and hence are the most vulnerable to sea level rise. Gloucester County is also the most"
developed of the Middle Peninsula localities. Most of its low lands are concentrated in a single
"area, Guinea Neck, where flooding on high tides is common. In Mathews County, low land is"
"dispersed and much of it is undeveloped. However, the northern portion of Mobjack Bay is"
"developed and is vulnerable to sea level rise. Although at relatively high elevations, Middlesex"
County is bayfront and therefore subject to erosion.
Northern Neck
"The Northern Neck has relatively high elevations, with only a few, small areas vulnerable to sea"
"level rise. The lowest community is Lewisetta, Northumberland County. Lewisetta is the only"
community vulnerable to inundation (in the next 100 years) along the Potomac River. It already
"experiences some tidal flooding of drainage ditches. However, portions of the Northern Neck"
are bayfront and subject to erosion.
Rappahannock Area
"Most of the Rappahannock area has relatively high elevation, and the major risk in this area is"
from increased erosion. Some of the lowest lying land in this area is owned by the military and
there are recreational beaches which may be vulnerable. Although the localities in this region
"are not highly developed, there is waterfront development along the rivers."
Northern Virginia
"This region is the northern-most area, located along the upper portion of the Potomac River."
This setting reduces expected wave energies thereby reducing erosion risk. Much of the
