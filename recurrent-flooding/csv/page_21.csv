Sea Level Rise
Sea level rise in Virginia is a documented fact. Water levels in Hampton Roads have risen more
than one foot over the past 80 years. The causes of this rise are well understood and current
analyses suggest the rate of rise is increasing. The consequence of higher sea level is evident in
the increased frequency of significant flooding events in coastal Virginia communities. A brief
explanation of current understanding about the factors driving sea level change in this region
can be found in Section 4.3 of this report.
The future of sea level change in Virginia is most appropriately forecast by reference to the
state-of-the-science synthesis and recommendations prepared for the National Climate
Assessment (Parris et al. 2012). The consensus of scientists working on this report is that by
2100 global sea level will be between 8 inches and 6.6 feet above the level in 1992. When
modified by local and regional factors this information provides the best available basis for
planning.
"In order to generate sea level rise scenarios to inform planning in Virginia, we have used the"
four scenarios developed for the National Climate Assessment and modified them by
incorporating an estimation of land subsidence in southeastern Virginia. Regional subsidence
has historically represented about one half of the change in relative sea level observed locally.
In the future it is anticipated that the regional rates of subsidence will remain relatively
constant while global rates of sea level rise increase. Therefore the future sea level scenarios
presented in Figure 16 are the global scenarios modified to include local subsidence (estimated
at 2.7 millimeters/year or about 0.1 inch/year).
The four scenarios represent plausible trajectories for local sea level based on a combination of
factors. The lowest or “historic” scenario is simply a projection of observed long-term rates of
"sea level rise going back a century or more, and contains no acceleration. Current rates of"
global sea level change based on satellite altimetry already are well above this trend line. The
"other three scenarios assume sea level rise rates are accelerating, which seems more consistent"
with recent studies (Boon 2012; Ezer and Corlett 2012; Sallenger et al. 2012). The “highest”
scenario is based on estimated consequences from global warming combined with the
maximum possible contribution from ice sheet loss and glacial melting (Pfeffer et al. 2008). This
is a practical worst case scenario based on current understandings. The “high” scenario is
based on the upper end of projections from semi-empirical models using statistical
"relationships in global observations of sea level and air temperature (Ramstorf 2007, Ramstorf"
et al. 2011). The “low” scenario is based on the IPCC fourth Assessment model using
conservative assumptions about future greenhouse gas emission (the B1 scenario). The science
