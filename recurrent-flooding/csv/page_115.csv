"Crater and Poquoson analyze wind events (including tornadoes, hurricanes, nor'easters) as a"
separate hazard. Poquoson listed all the historical tropical storms and differentiated whether
"the historic event was caused by flooding, high winds or both. Shoreline erosion (which is"
"driven by a number of natural influences such as sea level rise and land subsidence, large"
"storms, storm surge, and flooding) is typically incorporated into the flood section."
Not all plans identified sea level rise as a hazard but certain regions such as Southside Hampton
"Roads, Northern Virginia, and Middle Peninsula have more information on the topic and explain"
why the hazard will pose a greater threat in the future. For the plans that acknowledge sea
"level rise, it is generally accepted that increased flooding damage will result from sea level rise."
After the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) created new hurricane
"storm surge maps for the coast of Virginia in 2007, the Northern Neck PDC created the"
Northern Neck Regional Coastal Storm Surge Hazard Assessment to quantify the monetary
impact to real estate improvements of a category 1 hurricane storm surge throughout a
county's coastline. There are many assumptions inherent in this analysis that have mostly to do
with limitations with the GIS datasets but it is still helpful in identifying storm surge problem
areas for Northern Neck localities. The analysis looked at the total assessed value of all
improvements that have at least some area within the storm surge area as well as the
percentage of the total value for only those portions of buildings within the storm surge area.
Middle Peninsula Storm Surge Hazard Maps were developed by the U.S. Corp of Engineers in
conjunction with the VDEM as part of their 2008 Virginia Hurricane Evacuation Study. VDOT and
County officials in the Middle Peninsula region identified specific flood prone roads in the 100-
year and 500-year floodplain maps. The storm surge maps overlaid the evacuation route with
tidal storm surge impacts for a few coastal counties in the Middle Peninsula. The data only
reflect salt water flooding even though freshwater flooding may also occur with hurricane
events from heavy rainfall runoff. The storm surge hazard maps identify areas that can be
"expected as the result of Category 1, 2, 3 and 4 hurricanes, based on the Sea, Lake and"
Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The SLOSH model is best used for defining the
“worst case scenario” of potential maximum surge for particular locations as opposed to the
regional impact of one singular storm surge event (Salter’s Creek Consulting (2011). Southside

Capability and Mitigation
"A few regions completed a capability assessment of each jurisdiction's fiscal, administrative,"
"and technical capabilities. A review of existing plans, policies, programs, ordinances and staff"
expertise was completed to identify existing gaps within government activities that could
exacerbate a locality's vulnerability or hinder its ability to implement the hazard mitigation
