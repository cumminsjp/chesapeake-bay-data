,Pros:,
,o,The width reduces the potential for seepage of the water through the
,,embankment
,o,Soil stabilization work can increase ground resistance to soil liquefaction or
,,landslides during earthquakes
,o,"They allow views of, and access to, the waterfront"
,Cons:,
,o,They require huge quantities of fill
,o,"Unless the area is being newly developed or redeveloped, they require"
,,acquisition of large tracts of shoreline

,Pros:,
