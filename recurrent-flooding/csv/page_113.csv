populated area will have a much higher impact than a comparable event that occurs in a
"remote, unpopulated area. Chesapeake performed the vulnerability assessment in two ways –"
first by estimating the potential impacts on structures in a given planning area in the event of a
100 year flood and then by estimating the per capita planning area damage. The Eastern Shore
"prioritized hazards based on the probability of past events, number of structures damaged,"
"primary impacts, secondary impacts and potential mitigation options. Whereas the George"
Washington Regional Comission completed community specific and regional hazard analyses as
well as community specific and regional vulnerability assessments. The Middle Peninsula
"created a series of maps for each locality showing the location of structures, on-site sewage"
"disposal systems, census block groups data and evacuation routes in Flood Zone A and in Flood"
Zone AE for the 100-year floodplain as well as the 500-year floodplain.
"All of the regions except the Eastern Shore, which calculated the loss estimation in-house,"
"utilized FEMA’s loss estimating software, Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard (HAZUS-MH) for their"
vulnerability assessment. The George Washington Region lists and maps all the critical facilities
in the 100-year floodplain for each locality. While very few plans show a digital overlay of the
"FEMA floodplain maps in relation to critical facilities, most quantified repetitive loss properties"
using the HAZUS flood model total annualized loss. HAZUS-MH was used to perform an
"elevated structures analysis for Poquoson which found a total of $64,228,000 dollars could be"
saved during a 100-year coastal flood as a result of elevating 567 structures; a 16-percent
reduction in loss (City of Poquoson and AMEC Earth and Environmental (2009). City of
Poquoson Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan.

FEMA%20RIII%20091409.pdf). The problem with HAZUS-MH is that it uses census data from
2000 which likely underestimates the amount of development in the coastal zone for all
localities.
"In addition to HAZUS, Southside Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia used a qualitative"
assessment based on a Priority Risk Index tool to measure the degree of risk for identified
"hazards in local communities. For Northern Virginia and Northern Neck, the Virginia Tech"
Center for Geospatial Information and Technology and VDEM developed a standardized
methodology to compare different hazards’ risk on a jurisdictional basis including parameters
"such as history of occurrence, vulnerability of people in the hazard area, probable geographic"
"extent of the hazard area, and historical impact in terms of human lives and property. Northern"
Virginia overlaid digital flood data with local parcel data and used it to perform a GIS-based risk
"assessment for critical facilities. In the future, all the localities that have GIS data layers such as"
"digital flood data, tax parcel records and building footprint data, could begin to estimate total"
building exposure in the 100-year floodplain.
