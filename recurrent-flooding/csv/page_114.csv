Limitations
Virginia is still in the process of acquiring comprehensive light detection and ranging (LIDAR)
"data. These data will allow for more precise estimations of elevation, therefore improving the"
predictive capability of models. All of Coastal Virginia could greatly benefit from the availability
of LiDAR elevation data because LiDAR data will provide the resolution needed to map and
analyze storm water flooding issues in more detail.
"In general structural-loss estimates are based on best available data such as tax parcel,"
"structural characteristics of facilities, hazardous storage classifications, E911 building structures,"
"digital tax maps, census block information and construction type. but since this information"
"varies by locality, it limits the effectiveness of the regional hazard assessments. Each locality"
provided local critical facility and infrastructure data in some format but a comprehensive
inventory consistent across jurisdictions does not exist because there is not a universally
"accepted definition of what constitutes a critical facility. Structural inventories with elevation,"
high water marks and flood frequency data from all the localities could be very helpful in
preparing more accurate cost-benefit analyses but there continues to be a data gap in many of
the regions. Some plans underestimated the losses by treating all structures equally while some
"plans over estimate losses, by not taking into account which structures have been elevated or"
have had flood-proofing measures installed.
The Commonwealth of Virginia’s 2010 hazard mitigation plan ranking was based on the
National Climate Data Center (NCDC) database. A few regions used this same framework to
establish a common system for evaluating and ranking hazards. The majority of the data on
"historical weather-related events is from the Storm Event Database available from NCDC,"
whereas the numerical damage data and qualitative analysis are based on the collection of
"information reported by local offices of the NWS, as well as other local, State and Federal"
"agencies. Uncertainties are inherent in any loss estimation methodology, arising in part from"
incomplete scientific knowledge concerning specific hazards and their effects on the built
"environments, as well as incomplete datasets, approximations and simplifications of datasets"
"and relatively short time periods of records. As a result, inadequate information poses a"
problem for developing accurate loss estimates.
Hazards
Coastal flooding is the predominate threat throughout Tidewater Virginia; all regions stated
"flooding as a top priority. The majority of the flooding in all the regions is tidal flooding, which"
"primarily occurs in conjunction with coastal storms such as hurricanes, northeasters, and"
tropical storms but many regions are also subject to inland or riverine flooding. Most HMPs
distinguish between flooding caused by precipitation and coastal flooding hazards associated
"with hurricanes, tropical storms and nor'easters. Some plans such as Chesapeake, Richmond-"
