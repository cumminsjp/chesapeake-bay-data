,,"infrastructure from vulnerable areas when necessary and feasible, or otherwise reduce"
,,vulnerabilities.” 24
,2.,Implement an early warning system for flooding that would monitor rainfall and water
,,levels and notify relevant government agencies and the general public in the event of an
,,emergency.25
,3.,Improve the ability of local infrastructure to efficiently handle drainage in the event of
,,increased flooding. This could involve minimizing the construction of new impervious
,,surfaces in flood-prone areas. 26
,4.,"Amend existing zoning ordinances to require increased building elevations and setbacks,"
,,"flood-proofing, and reduced density for new construction within flood zones. 27"
,5.,Improve and enhance traffic rerouting and emergency evacuation protocols related to
,,flooding events. 28 (First responders love this stuff)
,6.,"Ensure that hospitals, evacuation refuge sites, fire and emergency rescue facilities, and"
,,key transportation routes are outside of inundation zones or are secured against
,,projected flooding.29
,7.,Redirect new infrastructure development away from low-lying neighborhoods and other
,,"at-risk areas, and elevate and armor existing critical infrastructure. 30"
,8.,Require private sector owners of infrastructure to conduct sea level rise vulnerability
,,assessments and develop their own sea level rise adaptation plans as a condition for
,,permit approval.31
,9.,Encourage the graduated repurposing of structures that are rendered unsuitable for
,,their current use by sea level rise.32 33
,10. Gradually withdraw public services in flooded areas. 34 35,

,,to mitigate the impacts of increased flooding and sea level rise. 36 (could be a good
,,voluntary strategy for public awareness.)
