"our shorelines tend to have many, small perpendicular roads, so tide gates and storm surge"
barriers are likely to be a more appropriate strategy than levees for most areas. Island localities
"and areas with state-owned waterfront are exceptions, and may be appropriate for levees."
"Water bodies large enough to warrant structures may cross locality boundaries, making state"
"coordination appropriate. In addition, these structures are expensive and potentially out of"
reach of individual localities.
"To create a flexible adaptation plan, the state would need to look at flooding throughout"
"Tidewater Virginia and group issues into tiers: 1) Areas that need immediate attention, 2) Areas"
"that will be facing problems ~40 years from now (given current predictions), and 3) Areas that"
will be facing problems ~100 years from now (given current predictions). The plan would
"include a series of steps and time frames for each step, addressing the first tier in the first steps"
and then moving through the tiers in order. As the state continues to monitor sea level rise and
"flood issues, it could slow the time frames if sea level rise acceleration slowed or flooding"
decreased and accelerate them if flooding increased. The plan can include different pathways
depending on changes in population that might move an area from one tier to the next.
A state-wide road plan for road elevation could combine incremental elevation with routine
"maintenance, targeting areas that are predicted to be impacted by flooding. Again, if sea level"
"rises more slowly than predictions, the elevation portion of the program could be suspended"
with minimal effort.
Level 2 – Locality actions
The localities would be primarily responsible for implementing the management and spatial
planning actions to minimize future risk from flooding. This should be done on a locality level
"because each locality has a unique culture and geology, and likely a unique set of appropriate"
"management actions. Management actions should be “low regret” actions, allowing more"
flexibility under changing conditions. Localities would also maintain the emergency services as
part of the multi-level plan.
A comprehensive list of policy/management actions can be found in Section 4.1 (Dumais and
Ness 2011). Localities can use this list to help determine the best actions for their localities.
Specific suggestions for Virginia Beach and the Eastern Shore can be found at:

Level 3 – Individual actions
Individuals should be encouraged to use soft engineering strategies when protecting their
properties as these tend to retain ecological services and are typically “low-regret” options in
"the long term. Where possible, individuals should be educated regarding current and future"
