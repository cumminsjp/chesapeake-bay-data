,"In Virginia, smaller barriers are used in a number of locations (e.g. Portsmouth)",
,Pros:,
,o,"One structure protects large areas, good for highly developed areas"
,o,Some designs still allow boat traffic which is necessary in port areas
,Cons:,
,o,"May encourage development in floodplain zones; risk may be low, but"
,,consequences may be high
,o,Can be very expensive
,o,Can increase the risk for precipitation flooding in upriver areas by preventing
,,drainage and therefore may need to be combined with pump stations

,Pros:,
,o,"Large areas can be protected by floodwalls, makes them very appropriate for"
,,urban areas
,o,"They can be planned for future expansion, making them relatively future-proof"
,o,"Properly designed and maintained, they can be very effective"
,o,They have a narrow footprint compared to levees and therefore don’t require as
,,much land acquisition to install
,o,Seawalls also harden the shoreline to prevent erosion
,Cons:,
,o,They break the connection between the upland and the shoreline and reduce
,,access to the water
