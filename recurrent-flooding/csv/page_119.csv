Section 4.3 Sea Level Rise in Virginia
"From: Hershner, C. and M. Mitchell. 2012. Rising Tides, Sinking Coast: How Virginia’s coastal"
communities can adapt to surging sea levels. Virginia Issues and Answers 17(2):22-27.
Sea level rise in Virginia is a documented fact. Water levels in Hampton Roads have risen more
than one foot over the past 80 years. The causes of this rise are well understood and current
analyses suggest the rate of rise is increasing (Boon 2012; Ezer & Corlett 2012; Sallenger et al.
2012). The consequence of higher sea level is evident in the increased frequency of significant
"flooding events in coastal Virginia communities. In the face of increasing risks, adaptation is"
"essential, and need to act is immediate."
"Sea level in Virginia is affected by three general factors: the volume of water in the ocean, the"
"elevation of the Virginia shoreline, and the movement of water in the ocean. All three things"
have been changing in recent times. The result for coastal Virginia has been a long-term and
recently accelerating rise in the level of tidal waters in the Commonwealth.
The first factor – the volume of water in the ocean - is simple to understand. Increasing the
volume of water in the ocean will unavoidably raise the water level at the shoreline. Two things
"are currently causing the volume of ocean water to increase. Glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets"
"in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, adding water that was stored on land surfaces to the"
"ocean basins. At the same time, the water in the oceans is warming causing it to expand."
Together these processes are believed to have added over half a foot to ocean levels in the past
"century. Both of these processes have increased recently, and now are adding to the oceans’"
volume at about twice the former rate. Depending on how much the earth’s atmosphere
"warms, these rates are anticipated to increase even further."
The second factor – the elevation of Virginia’s shoreline – is surprising for many people living
here. It turns out that Virginia’s coast is sinking. Again there are a number of things causing
this. The primary cause is the continuing adjustment of the earth’s crust to the melting of
"glaciers from the last ice age. About 25,000 years ago, huge ice sheets extended from the"
North Pole all the way south to what is now northern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. These ice
"sheets were estimated to be over a mile thick, exerting tremendous pressure on the earth’s"
"crust, actually causing it to bulge up in the region of Virginia. As the ice sheet melted and"
"retreated northward, that pressure was released and the earth’s crust has been slowly"
readjusting ever since. The result is a slow sinking of the mid-Atlantic coastal region.
"In addition to the general subsidence of the region, there are two other more local processes"
that are adding to the general sinking of our land area. The first is the continuing compaction
of the materials that were blasted apart when a meteor struck the area near Cape Charles
"about 35 million years ago. Materials in the impact crater, which extends from the mouth of"
