Section 4.2 GIS methodology
Existing state-wide models of elevation (or topographic) surfaces use DEMs (Digital Elevation
Models) developed from the Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP). DEMs have less vertical
"and horizontal resolution than newer techniques, which can result in over-estimating areas of"
potential inundation. More accurate LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data are still being
"collected for portions of the Tidewater Virginia region. Therefore, we built a new surface for"
"Tidewater Virginia, consisting of LiDAR data where available and DEMs in the few localities"
"where LiDAR are not yet available. The surface we created has the most recent, highest"
"resolution elevation data currently existing. Onto the newly created surface, we projected a"
"sea level rise of 1.5 feet and a storm surge of 4.5 feet (3 feet above sea level rise, considered a"
"reasonable surge for a large, but typical storm)."
Figure 10 shows the distribution of data type by locality. Most of the LiDAR data layers came
"referenced to North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD88), a standard geodetic vertical"
datum. Any data layers that were in a different vertical datum were converted to NAVD88
before using. A geographic information system (ArcGIS) was used to combine the data layers
"into seamless elevation surfaces for five regions: Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula, Peninsula,"
"Southside, and Eastern Shore. These highly detailed surfaces resulted in very large files,"
between 50 and 150 gigabytes for each dataset. This meant processing times were
"considerable, as much as 24 hours for each step in the procedure, with a minimum of 16 steps"
per region.
"In order to determine what land areas would flood, the elevation surfaces needed to be"
referenced to a tidal datum. We chose to reference our surfaces to present mean higher high
"water (MHHW), so our sea level rise and storm surge values represent water levels above this"
"reference. Using this adjustment, sea level rise is calculated from the highest point typically"
inundated daily. Adjusting from NAVD88 to MHHW involved using software developed by
"NOAA called VDatum, whose primary purpose is to convert elevation data between different"
vertical reference systems. The basic concept involves many elevation points along the
"shoreline being converted from NAVD88 to MHHW, and then extrapolated inland. The"
adjusted surface used in this analysis was provided by NOAA’s Coastal Services Center. This
adjusted surface was subtracted from the NAVD88-referenced elevation surface to create a
MHHW-referenced elevation surface.
"Using the MHHW-referenced elevation surfaces for each region, all elevations less than or"
equal to 1.5 feet were extracted to represent the area flooded by this potential sea level rise.
Next all elevations greater than 1.5 and less than or equal to 4.5 feet were extracted to
represent the area flooded by a 3 foot storm surge on top of the 1.5 foot sea level rise. The
"areal extents of these two scenarios were overlain on three different elements: land use,"
