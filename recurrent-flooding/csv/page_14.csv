An example of an increase in flooding issues can be seen in this graph of the hours per year that
"the Hague (Norfolk, VA) has flooded based on measurements at the NOAA Sewells Point tide"
"gauge (graph courtesy of Dr. Larry Atkinson, CCSLRI, Old Dominion University)."
"For this report we have reviewed information on issue identification, risk assessment, planning"
"tools, and other related material, which is summarized in Section 4.1 of this report as"
background for the summary presented here. In response to the charge from the General
"Assembly, we have developed information for localities in Virginia’s coastal zone (Figure 1)."
"Because the area is so large, for purposes of the report we present much of the mapped"
information by individual Tidewater regions (Figure 2). Even at this scale much of the detail is
"obscured, and so we will establish and maintain a website for the report and supporting"
information that will provide access to the digital data used to generate the maps.
Risk Assessment: Where is the problem?
There are two ways to determine the location of flooding problems. The most direct is to
document observations of flooding and flood damages. The second is to review elevation maps
and identify areas where flooding can occur. For this report both approaches have been used.
Each has limitations based on the fact that comprehensive and highly accurate data are not yet
available for either analysis.
