Definitions
Adaptation
"Adaptation is an adjustment in ecological, social or economic systems in response to actual or"
expected stimuli and their effects or impacts (IPCC 2001). It refers to changes in practices or
"structures that moderate the effects of, or reduce the impacts of an outside force to reduce"
"potential damages. In particular, it refers to practices that reduce vulnerability to or"
consequences of outside forces.
"There are 3 main types of flood adaptation: 1) Management/Retreat, when natural forces are"
"allowed to continue to function and human impacts are minimized by avoiding, minimizing or"
"regulating human use of the coastal area; 2) Accommodation, when people continue to use and"
"occupy the coastal zone, but adapt their lifestyle to reduce flood impacts; 3) Protection, when"
structural (hard or soft) engineering aims to protect the land from the water (similar to Mclean
and Tysban 2001).
"Planned adaptations are those based on policy changes either reacting to, or anticipating"
"changes in conditions. Autonomous (or spontaneous) adaptations are reactive changes,"
typically private sector initiatives (individuals or communities) (Smit and Pilifosova 2001).
Consequences
Consequences are the economic and human damages resulting from a given flood event.
Flood Risk
Flood risk is the probability of a flood occurring. It is typically expressed as the likelihood of a
flood occurring in a given year or as a recurrence frequency (e.g. the 10-year storm).
Global Sea Level Rise
Global sea level rise is the worldwide increase in the volume of the world’s oceans that occurs
as a result of thermal expansion and melting ice caps and glaciers (Titus et al. 2010).
Nor’easters or Winter Storms
Winter coastal storms are characterized by strong winds from the northeast quadrant over long
reaches of coast. These winds are part of a counter clock-wise cyclonic atmospheric circulation
about a center of atmospheric low pressure at sea. The proximity of warm Gulf Stream water to
the colder continent during winter and spring favors the development of such storms (Ho et al.
1976).
Relative Sea Level Rise
"Relative sea level rise refers to the change in sea level relative to the elevation of the land,"
"which includes global sea level rise, land subsidence and changes in ocean circulation (Titus et al."
2010).
