trillion gallons of untreated stormwater containing human sewage every year (EPA 2004). This
suggests that new stormwater systems should be designed to handle larger storms than we are
currently experiencing.
"More research should be done on storm intensity trends in Virginia, so that we can incorporate"
these trends while planning our infrastructure.
Storm Surge
"Nor’easters typically move rapidly to the north and northeast past the coast of Virginia, but"
under favorable conditions in the general atmospheric circulation they can stall and intensify
with little forward motion for a couple of days (Ho et al. 1976). This can generate long lasting
storm surges. Research looking directly at storm surge data for the southeastern United States
"found a significant increasing trend in the number of moderately large storm surges, and 44 of"
the top 50 storm surge events between 1923 and 2008 were related to tropical storm activity
(Grinsted et al. 2012). Although tropical storms tend not to affect the system for as long as
extratropical storms they should be considered equally important drivers of flooding.
"Therefore, it is important to understand changes in both types of storm systems to predict"
"future flood events. However, the body of science addressing these topics is still actively"
"growing, making it difficult to predict future trends at this time."
Tropical storms
Much recent research has been done on the question of whether tropical storm activity is
increasing. Hurricane activity in the North Atlantic appears to have been increasing significantly
since 1995 (Nyberg et al. 2008) although the mechanism is unclear. Research on tropical
storms in the North Atlantic Basin suggest that there is an increase in storm activity in the 20 th
"century, but not necessarily an increase in storm intensity (i.e. proportion of hurricanes to"
tropical storms remain constant) (Holland and Webster 2007). It is also unresolved whether the
"increase in tropical storm activity is part of a cycle or is a return to normal hurricane activity,"
following a period of anomalously low activity in the 1970’s.
"Tropical storm activity has been linked to sea surface temperatures, El Niño, the North Atlantic"
"Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation among others, all of which are predicted"
to change over time (as cited in: Grinsted et al. 2012). The frequency of storms differs between
"warm and cold years, with the warm years having more storm activity, with the strongest effect"
on the largest storms (Grinsted et al. 2012). Trends suggest that Hurricane Katrina-size storms
are twice as frequent in warm years than in cold years (Grinsted et al. 2012). Determining
trends in storm activity is hampered by the changing observational and record keeping quality
"over time. Additionally, an increase in tropical storm activity in the North Atlantic Basin does"
not necessarily correlate with an increase in storms making landfall in Virginia.
