"MH is the use of old census data, which makes the analysis underestimate impacts in regions"
"that have recently seen increased growth. However, FEMA is currently updating HAZUS-MH"
"with 2010 census data, which should help alleviate concerns in that area. It can be obtained at:"

Shallow Water Vulnerability model
The Shallow Water Vulnerability model primarily was designed to project broad-scale climate
"change effects on future distributions of coastal habitats. However, it also shows areas of"
developed lands that are vulnerable to sea level rise. The model has been run for the entirety of
Tidewater Virginia. The final report is at:
http://ccrm.vims.edu/research/climate_change/COASTALHABITATS_FinalReport.pdf. Maps of
"each locality, with current and future projected conditions can be found at:"

They report that “Many low-lying segments are in danger of losing high percentages of
infrastructure and residences near the coastline in the next 50-100 years (e.g. Mobjack Bay
"(51%), Tangier Island (99%), and Middle York River (37%)).” Most segments are in danger of"
losing some portion of their developed lands.
