In preparing this report we found:,In preparing this report we found:
1.,Recurrent flooding is a significant issue in Virginia coastal localities and one that is
,predicted to become worse over reasonable planning horizons (20-50 years).
2.,The risks associated with recurrent flooding are not the same throughout all areas of
,Tidewater Virginia.
3.,Data are often lacking for comprehensive and/or fine resolution analysis of flood risks in
,the region.
4.,Review of global flood and sea level rise management strategies suggests that it is
,possible for Virginia to have an effective response to increasing flood issues BUT it takes
,time (20-30 years) to effectively plan and implement many of the adaptation strategies.
