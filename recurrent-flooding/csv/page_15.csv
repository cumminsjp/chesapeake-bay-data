Where has flooding been observed?
While there are frequent media reports of areas flooded by large rain events and coastal
"storms, records and maps of these locations do not exist in any comprehensive database. Some"
"localities maintain records of emergency calls or storm sewer backups, but these records are"
neither uniform nor consistently available across the coastal region. Assembling records into a
"consistent database would be useful for development of a state strategy, but it will require time"
and resources beyond those available for this report.
There are two data sets that are available for the entire region: a repetitive loss record
maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and a road closure
database maintained by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). Neither is truly
comprehensive in so far as the FEMA records only identify properties for which FEMA resources
"have been utilized, and the VDOT data only address state maintained roadways."
The FEMA database identifies properties that have received two or more claim payments of
"more than $1,000 from the National Flood Insurance Program within any rolling 10-year period"
for a home or business. Information is available on the number of repetitive loss properties by
census block. We have mapped that information for each of the Virginia coastal regions
"covered by this report (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). FEMA also reports cumulative repetitive loss claims"
which provide another picture of the geographic distribution of flooding problems in Virginia’s
coastal zone (Figure 8). It is important to remember in viewing this information that it is limited
"to claims in the National Flood Insurance Program, and only a fraction of Virginia properties"
participate in that program.
The VDOT database is a 4 year record of road closures due to flooding on state maintained
roads (Figure 9). Similar information is not uniformly available for locally maintained roads.
The VDOT database provides one picture of areas at risk from flooding. Areas of recurrent
flooding are of particular interest because they indicate locations that should be priorities for
"management. Flooding in tunnels and near bridges is of concern, since road closures in these"
areas can be a hindrance to evacuation and emergency services. Coastal Virginia’s unique
geography (a series of peninsulas connected by bridges and tunnels) frequently means that
"there are few alternative routes, and that a closure on a main road can result in long and"
complicated detours.
Results from EM surveys
Emergency managers are the last line of defense against flooding and are a crucial part of
"hazard mitigation planning efforts. Due to their experience, they often have unique knowledge"
regarding the causes and frequency of flooding in their localities. To tap into this knowledge
"base, we attended two regional emergency managers meetings (the Northern Neck and Middle"
Peninsula Regional Emergency Manager Meeting and the Regional Emergency Management
