,"Examples: Used throughout the world; in Virginia, it has been done in a few localities",
,Pros:,
,o,"Elevated roads can act as a levee, protecting both the road and the area behind"
,,it
,o,Future-proof in rural areas where roads can be raised to the necessary level
,,"every cycle of paving; if there is no longer a need to raise them, the process is"
,,easily stopped
,Cons:,
,o,Elevated roads may cause ponding of water on adjacent properties
,o,Can be expensive and complicated in urban areas
,o,"May need to be done repeatedly, unless there are reasonable predictions of the"
,,"final elevation needed and the available funds to do a large, one time project"

,Examples: Floating homes are used in Seattle and Amsterdam (but these houses float,

,Pros:,
,o,"Future-proof, allows houses to adapt to sea level rise"
,o,Some consider it to be environmentally friendly (Tong 2012)
,o,"Unlike elevated structures, these houses are typically on the ground so there are"
,,no access issues
,o,"Handles flooding, but not necessarily designed to handle wave action or winds"
,Cons:,
,o,Requires engineering skills that may be expensive or difficult to find
,o,Utilities are usually designed to separate from the house during floating which a)
,,leaves residents without sewer or water systems and b) allows HVAC systems
,,and such to flood
,o,"Handles flooding, but not necessarily designed to handle wave action or wind"
,o,Effectiveness is reduced when a greater than anticipated storm surge occurs
