"surge, while in bays and sounds, slower storms produce higher surges. In Virginia, nor’easters"
"arguably have a larger storm surge impact because they tend to move slowly, raising water"
"levels over multiple tidal cycles (Davis and Dolan 1993), while hurricanes storm surges create"
the most flooding when they coincide with high tide. Models suggest that for small to
"moderate storms, storm surge increases about 30 cm per 10mb pressure, while for large"
"storms, storm surge increases about 40 cm per 10mb pressure (Westerrink et al. 1992)."
Trends in both high intensity precipitation and storm surge are complicated by the fact that
weather patterns tend to follow cycles. This means that a short dataset may show an
increasing or decreasing trend in a weather pattern while a longer dataset may suggest a cyclic
pattern. The best information can be gathered from datasets long enough to show multiple
cycles. These datasets can be analyzed to see if the cycles themselves appear to be trending up
"or down. At this time, the understanding of climate controls on changing patterns of"
"storminess and storm surge are limited, reducing confidence in future projections of coastal"
storm impacts (Burkett and Davidson 2012).
Precipitation
"There are no clear trends in historic records of annual rainfall in Virginia, although it is predicted"
to increase by approximately 6% in Virginia (NCA 2012). Analyses of the 24-hour maximum
"rainfall frequency indicate an upward trend in coastal Virginia (Bonnin et al. 2006). However,"
"when considering flooding from precipitation, we are more concerned with the number of high"
"intensity rain events, rather than the total annual precipitation. High intensity rain events are"
typically the ones that lead to flooding. Scientists predict increasing storm intensity (leading to
"higher per storm precipitation), but the trend varies globally and even within the United States."
"Between 1948 and 2006, there appears to have been a 25% increase in the frequency of"
extreme precipitation events in Virginia (Madsen and Figdor 2007). Extending the dataset to
"2011, there appears to have been a 33% increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation"
"events, with the 1-year storm now occurring every 9 months (Madsen and Wilcox 2012). As the"
"frequency of extreme events has increased, so has the amount of rain that those storms"
"produce (i.e. the biggest storms are getting bigger), with Virginia seeing an 11% increase in"
precipitation from the largest storms between 1948 and 2011 (Madsen and Wilcox 2012).
This trend has implications for how we design our water management systems. Storm water
drainage systems are typically designed to handle storms of a certain frequency (e.g. a 2-year
storm design would handle storm water from a level of precipitation predicted to occur once
"every 2 years). As storm frequency increases, levels of precipitation that are currently expected"
only every five years will start to occur every two years. In the Virginia urban areas with
"combined sewer/stormwater systems, changes in storm intensity could have health and"
environmental impacts. The U.S. EPA estimates that sewer overflows discharge about one
