properly apportion those expenses to properties requiring extra expenses would be through
the use of a special taxing district wherein residents in high risk zones are assessed a higher tax
"to pay for those services, sending a clear financial signal as well into those areas. Virginia Code"
at § 15.2-2400 allows the creation of local government special districts to accomplish certain
necessary tasks and could be used in high-risk inundation zones to create disincentives for land
uses at odds with higher risk from flooding and sea level rise.
Direct Investment and Infrastructure Decisions That Could Include Flooding/Sea
Level Rise
Each Virginia locality is authorized at Virginia Code §15.2-2239 to prepare a capital
improvement plan (CIP) to plan needed capital investments. The preparation of the CIP usually
occurs with comprehensive land use planning updates and offers a chance for inundation and
sea level rise impacts to be made part of local government infrastructure investment decisions.
"Placement of roads, schools, fire houses, police stations, and other public facilities are governed"
"by the CIP, and all these facilities need to account for sea level rise in coastal communities."
"At the federal level, projects built under the authority of the US Army Corps of Engineers"
"(USACE) Civil Works program, are required to take sea level rise into account, according to an"
"engineering guidance issued October 1, 2011. This guidance states, “Potential relative sea-level"
change must be considered in every USACE coastal activity as far inland as the extent of
estimated tidal influence.” The guidance and a web-based tool maintained by the USACE
outline the steps needed for all civil works infrastructure projects along the coastline.
"This policy is the only example of a prospective policy in federal and Virginia state authorities,"
one that anticipates a future state of inundation risk and sea level rise. It has been verified that
"the proposed port facility at Craney Island, developed with USACE involvement, does take"
modest sea level rise into account in its design.
Regulatory Authorities in Virginia that Could Include Flooding/Sea level Rise
"Programs exist at the local, state, and federal level to regulate development activities along the"
"tidal shoreline in Virginia, areas that are increasingly at risk from sea level rise and inundation."
Some of these authorities reside in local government zoning and building ordinances. Other
authorities place restrictions on development along these shorelines in order to protect the
natural ecosystem. These authorities can be used to keep the shoreline open and resilient and
better able to adapt to sea level rise. They can also be used to keep infrastructure and housing
out of shoreline areas that will be at increasing risk from sea level rise.
The strongest potential climate change adaptation regulatory tools are local zoning and building
code authorities since these govern the use of land and the placement of infrastructure along
the shoreline and also set minimum building safety and performance standards. Counties in
