"Potomac River shoreline is owned by the National Park Service, and thus, is undeveloped"
(although the George Washington Memorial Parkway runs along the waterfront). There are
"two low lying areas prone to flooding, Old Towne, Alexandria and Belle Haven, Fairfax County."
These areas are the most vulnerable to sea level rise in the region.
Predictions of future impacts: Impacts of Sea Level Rise on infrastructure
There are three major threats to road systems from rising sea level: alterations to the drainage
"capacity, flooding of evacuation routes, increased hydraulic pressure on tunnels (Titus 2003)."
"Most roads have some type of drainage system, and in many low-lying areas roads are built at a"
lower elevation than the surrounding land to drain properties. These drainage systems rely on
"hydraulic head (from a slope to the waterway) to drain properly. As sea level rises, that slope"
"declines, decreasing the capacity of the drainage system. This can cause stormwater to back up"
"or pond, causing flooding. In areas subject to storm surge flooding, rising sea level may cause"
"the road to flood earlier, potentially cutting off evacuation routes. This requires that"
evacuation decisions be made earlier and can increase the risk to life. Roads and bridges can be
"raised as sea level rises, however, tunnels are relatively static constructions. Tunnels are used"
throughout Southside Virginia to ensure navigability of channels. If tunnel entrances cannot be
"raised, there is danger of flooding in the tunnels and a higher water table (due to sea level rise)"
results in increased hydraulic pressure on the tunnel structure (Titus 2003). Sea level rise is also
"predicted to increase coastal erosion. In coastal Virginia, many roads are adjacent to"
"waterways. Erosion of the shoreline adjacent to these roads puts the roads at risk of collapse,"
potentially cutting off access to portions of the road.
"Navigation is an important consideration for coastal Virginia, where port facilities and boat"
"traffic are a key part of the economic activity. Sea level rise will make channels deeper,"
allowing access to deeper draft vessels but will also reduce clearance under bridges (Titus
2003). Reduced clearance under bridges is unlikely to be a major problem in coastal Virginia
"due to the large number of drawbridges. However, sea level rise may be a problem for some"
port facilities and docks and piers where structures are built at an optimum height relative to
sea level (Titus 2003). How big of an issue sea level rise becomes for these structures depends
on the relationship between the rate of sea level rise and the expected lifespan of the
"structures. If the structures require renovations or rebuilding every 20-30 years anyway, new"
sea level heights could be taken into account at the time.
Other transportation at risk in Virginia includes airports and railroads. Reagan National Airport
"(located in Arlington, VA) has runways immediately adjacent to tidal waters. They are at risk"
from storm surge flooding and also at risk from Potomac River flooding. Sea level rise is
expected to exacerbate this problem and may shorten the runways (Titus 2003). Railroad lines
in coastal Virginia are used both for transportation and freight movement
