,create evacuation issues when people stay too long at their residence.,
,Pros:,
,o,"Protects homes, vehicles, and people better than first-floor elevation"
,,requirements
,o,Effective in areas with both low elevations and high elevations
,o,Adjusting the elevation of the setback allows for future-proofing of the
,,adaptation measure
,Cons:,
,o,"In areas with low elevations, large swaths of land may be too low for building"
