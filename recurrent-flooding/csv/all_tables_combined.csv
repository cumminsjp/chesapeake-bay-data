Definitions
Adaptation
"Adaptation is an adjustment in ecological, social or economic systems in response to actual or"
expected stimuli and their effects or impacts (IPCC 2001). It refers to changes in practices or
"structures that moderate the effects of, or reduce the impacts of an outside force to reduce"
"potential damages. In particular, it refers to practices that reduce vulnerability to or"
consequences of outside forces.
"There are 3 main types of flood adaptation: 1) Management/Retreat, when natural forces are"
"allowed to continue to function and human impacts are minimized by avoiding, minimizing or"
"regulating human use of the coastal area; 2) Accommodation, when people continue to use and"
"occupy the coastal zone, but adapt their lifestyle to reduce flood impacts; 3) Protection, when"
structural (hard or soft) engineering aims to protect the land from the water (similar to Mclean
and Tysban 2001).
"Planned adaptations are those based on policy changes either reacting to, or anticipating"
"changes in conditions. Autonomous (or spontaneous) adaptations are reactive changes,"
typically private sector initiatives (individuals or communities) (Smit and Pilifosova 2001).
Consequences
Consequences are the economic and human damages resulting from a given flood event.
Flood Risk
Flood risk is the probability of a flood occurring. It is typically expressed as the likelihood of a
flood occurring in a given year or as a recurrence frequency (e.g. the 10-year storm).
Global Sea Level Rise
Global sea level rise is the worldwide increase in the volume of the world’s oceans that occurs
as a result of thermal expansion and melting ice caps and glaciers (Titus et al. 2010).
Nor’easters or Winter Storms
Winter coastal storms are characterized by strong winds from the northeast quadrant over long
reaches of coast. These winds are part of a counter clock-wise cyclonic atmospheric circulation
about a center of atmospheric low pressure at sea. The proximity of warm Gulf Stream water to
the colder continent during winter and spring favors the development of such storms (Ho et al.
1976).
Relative Sea Level Rise
"Relative sea level rise refers to the change in sea level relative to the elevation of the land,"
"which includes global sea level rise, land subsidence and changes in ocean circulation (Titus et al."
2010).
2
Sea Level
"Sea level refers to the average level of tidal waters, generally measured over a 19-year period."
The 19-year cycle is necessary to smooth out variations in water levels caused by seasonal
weather fluctuations and the 18.6-year cycle in the moon’s orbit. The sea level measured at a
particular tide gauge is often referred to as local mean sea level (LMSL) (Titus et al. 2010).
Storm Surge
"Storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted"
astronomical tide. It is caused primarily by the winds from a storm and is linked to both tropical
and extratropical storms.
Storm Tide
Storm tide is the water level rise during a storm due to the combination of storm surge and the
astronomical tide.
Vulnerability
"Vulnerability is the potential for damage to individuals, society and the environment. It can be"
reduced through the use of adaptation strategies.

The problem is increasingly frequent storm-driven water levels that flood developed areas.,
,4
An example of an increase in flooding issues can be seen in this graph of the hours per year that
"the Hague (Norfolk, VA) has flooded based on measurements at the NOAA Sewells Point tide"
"gauge (graph courtesy of Dr. Larry Atkinson, CCSLRI, Old Dominion University)."
"For this report we have reviewed information on issue identification, risk assessment, planning"
"tools, and other related material, which is summarized in Section 4.1 of this report as"
background for the summary presented here. In response to the charge from the General
"Assembly, we have developed information for localities in Virginia’s coastal zone (Figure 1)."
"Because the area is so large, for purposes of the report we present much of the mapped"
information by individual Tidewater regions (Figure 2). Even at this scale much of the detail is
"obscured, and so we will establish and maintain a website for the report and supporting"
information that will provide access to the digital data used to generate the maps.
Risk Assessment: Where is the problem?
There are two ways to determine the location of flooding problems. The most direct is to
document observations of flooding and flood damages. The second is to review elevation maps
and identify areas where flooding can occur. For this report both approaches have been used.
Each has limitations based on the fact that comprehensive and highly accurate data are not yet
available for either analysis.
5
Where has flooding been observed?
While there are frequent media reports of areas flooded by large rain events and coastal
"storms, records and maps of these locations do not exist in any comprehensive database. Some"
"localities maintain records of emergency calls or storm sewer backups, but these records are"
neither uniform nor consistently available across the coastal region. Assembling records into a
"consistent database would be useful for development of a state strategy, but it will require time"
and resources beyond those available for this report.
There are two data sets that are available for the entire region: a repetitive loss record
maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and a road closure
database maintained by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). Neither is truly
comprehensive in so far as the FEMA records only identify properties for which FEMA resources
"have been utilized, and the VDOT data only address state maintained roadways."
The FEMA database identifies properties that have received two or more claim payments of
"more than $1,000 from the National Flood Insurance Program within any rolling 10-year period"
for a home or business. Information is available on the number of repetitive loss properties by
census block. We have mapped that information for each of the Virginia coastal regions
"covered by this report (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). FEMA also reports cumulative repetitive loss claims"
which provide another picture of the geographic distribution of flooding problems in Virginia’s
coastal zone (Figure 8). It is important to remember in viewing this information that it is limited
"to claims in the National Flood Insurance Program, and only a fraction of Virginia properties"
participate in that program.
The VDOT database is a 4 year record of road closures due to flooding on state maintained
roads (Figure 9). Similar information is not uniformly available for locally maintained roads.
The VDOT database provides one picture of areas at risk from flooding. Areas of recurrent
flooding are of particular interest because they indicate locations that should be priorities for
"management. Flooding in tunnels and near bridges is of concern, since road closures in these"
areas can be a hindrance to evacuation and emergency services. Coastal Virginia’s unique
geography (a series of peninsulas connected by bridges and tunnels) frequently means that
"there are few alternative routes, and that a closure on a main road can result in long and"
complicated detours.
Results from EM surveys
Emergency managers are the last line of defense against flooding and are a crucial part of
"hazard mitigation planning efforts. Due to their experience, they often have unique knowledge"
regarding the causes and frequency of flooding in their localities. To tap into this knowledge
"base, we attended two regional emergency managers meetings (the Northern Neck and Middle"
Peninsula Regional Emergency Manager Meeting and the Regional Emergency Management
6
"Technical Advisory Committee (A Hampton Roads Regional group)). At both meetings, we gave"
a presentation about the flooding study and then asked the emergency managers in attendance
to respond to some questions. We sent the same set of questions to the other emergency
manager meetings that had members from Tidewater Virginia.
"A list of all the localities that responded to the survey, and the survey questions and answers"
can be found in Section 4.5: Emergency Manager Survey Responses.
Almost all respondents said that they were aware of roads that must be closed or signed for
"flooding issues, which concurs with VDOTs road flooding data (see Precipitation flooding: Road"
"Closures, Section 4.1). Nearly half of respondents say areas flood during normal high tides and"
nearly 3⁄4 say that areas flood during extreme high tides. All but 3 respondents claim that some
portion of their locality floods during large storms. This indicates that flooding is a widespread
problem.
Localities are addressing flooding issues. Most emergency managers were aware of locality
plans that dealt with some aspect of flooding issues and claimed that critical infrastructure
inside of flooding areas had been identified. Most localities have considered some type of
adaptation strategy to address flooding. Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula localities
considered elevating road surfaces and raising structures as the primary adaptation strategies.
These localities tend to have populations that are relatively spread out and roads with little
associated infrastructure (e.g. stormwater drainage systems). The Regional Emergency
Management Technical Advisory Committee (REMTAC; composed of Hampton Roads localities)
"localities considered a wide variety of adaptations, including (in order of popularity): raising"
"structures, relocating people, elevating road surfaces and sea walls, and pumping"
"stations/dams/levees. Pumping stations, dams, and levees are expensive engineering"
strategies and therefore are most likely to be considered in areas where concentrated
"development allows for each engineering structure to protect a large number of properties,"
bringing the cost per property down.
"Despite the fact that flooding is an issue for almost all respondent localities, less than 1/3 saw"
"sea level rise as contributing to their flooding issues. However, most of them were interested in"
learning more about the impacts of sea level rise in their localities.
"Flooding has been observed in all of Virginia’s coastal localities, but assessing the magnitude of"
past issues is constrained by lack of compiled data.
Where can flooding be expected?
The risk of flooding can be assessed by examining detailed information about land elevation
"and proximity to water. In recent years, this type of analysis has been done for a variety of"
7
purposes generating a multitude of maps purporting to show areas at risk for potential flooding,purposes generating a multitude of maps purporting to show areas at risk for potential flooding

"intensity rain events, rather than the total annual precipitation. High intensity rain events are"
typically the ones that lead to flooding. Scientists predict increasing storm intensity (leading to
"higher per storm precipitation), but the trend varies globally and even within the United States."
"Between 1948 and 2006, there appears to have been a 25% increase in the frequency of"
extreme precipitation events in Virginia (Madsen and Figdor 2007). Extending the dataset to
"2011, there appears to have been a 33% increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation"
"events, with the 1-year storm now occurring every 9 months (Madsen and Wilcox 2012). As the"
"frequency of extreme events has increased, so has the amount of rain that those storms"
"produce (i.e. the biggest storms are getting bigger), with Virginia seeing an 11% increase in"
precipitation from the largest storms between 1948 and 2011 (Madsen and Wilcox 2012).
Tropical storms
Much recent research has been done on the question of whether tropical storm activity is
increasing. Hurricane activity in the North Atlantic appears to have been increasing significantly
since 1995 (Nyberg et al. 2008) although the mechanism is unclear. Research on tropical
storms in the North Atlantic Basin suggest that there is an increase in storm activity in the 20 th
"century, but not necessarily an increase in storm intensity (i.e. proportion of hurricanes to"
tropical storms remain constant) (Holland and Webster 2007). It also is unresolved whether the
"increase in tropical storm activity is part of a cycle or is a return to normal hurricane activity,"
following a period of anomalously low activity in the 1970’s.
The only research found on tropical storm frequency in Virginia (making landfall) looks at data
from the 1800-1990’s and suggests that there is a 50-year cycle in the number of tropical
"storms and hurricanes, with the peak of the cycle lasting about 15 years (Roth and Cobb, year"
unknown). This concurs with other research suggesting that tropical storm tracks are driven by
"random fluctuations in atmospheric steering currents, making the data sets too “noisy” (filled"
with unexplained variations) to detect long-term trends in tropical storm landfall (Landsea
2005; Vecchi and Knutson 2011).
Winter Storms
Most of the storm tides with a 10-yr return period magnitude in coastal Virginia are caused by
winter storms (or nor’easters) (Ho et al. 1976) making them a critical driver of the most
"frequent storm surges (Boon 2012). In the United States, the average loss per storm (in $$) as"
well as the average storm intensity (measured as numbers of states impacted by a single storm)
"appears to be increasing (Changnon 2007). In Virginia, winter storm occurrences between 1984"
"and 2003 were 130% higher than during the previous 20 year time period, potentially related to"
a southern shift in the Arctic front in the latter time period (Changnon 2007). Research on 50
years of data suggests that the annual frequency of the strongest nor’easters is related to the
11
"position of the southerly jet-stream, which varies on an annual basis (Davis and Dolan 1993)"
and may be cyclical.
Sea Level Rise
Sea level rise in Virginia is a documented fact. Water levels in Hampton Roads have risen more
than one foot over the past 80 years. The causes of this rise are well understood and current
analyses suggest the rate of rise is increasing. The consequence of higher sea level is evident in
the increased frequency of significant flooding events in coastal Virginia communities. A brief
explanation of current understanding about the factors driving sea level change in this region
can be found in Section 4.3 of this report.
The future of sea level change in Virginia is most appropriately forecast by reference to the
state-of-the-science synthesis and recommendations prepared for the National Climate
Assessment (Parris et al. 2012). The consensus of scientists working on this report is that by
2100 global sea level will be between 8 inches and 6.6 feet above the level in 1992. When
modified by local and regional factors this information provides the best available basis for
planning.
"In order to generate sea level rise scenarios to inform planning in Virginia, we have used the"
four scenarios developed for the National Climate Assessment and modified them by
incorporating an estimation of land subsidence in southeastern Virginia. Regional subsidence
has historically represented about one half of the change in relative sea level observed locally.
In the future it is anticipated that the regional rates of subsidence will remain relatively
constant while global rates of sea level rise increase. Therefore the future sea level scenarios
presented in Figure 16 are the global scenarios modified to include local subsidence (estimated
at 2.7 millimeters/year or about 0.1 inch/year).
The four scenarios represent plausible trajectories for local sea level based on a combination of
factors. The lowest or “historic” scenario is simply a projection of observed long-term rates of
"sea level rise going back a century or more, and contains no acceleration. Current rates of"
global sea level change based on satellite altimetry already are well above this trend line. The
"other three scenarios assume sea level rise rates are accelerating, which seems more consistent"
with recent studies (Boon 2012; Ezer and Corlett 2012; Sallenger et al. 2012). The “highest”
scenario is based on estimated consequences from global warming combined with the
maximum possible contribution from ice sheet loss and glacial melting (Pfeffer et al. 2008). This
is a practical worst case scenario based on current understandings. The “high” scenario is
based on the upper end of projections from semi-empirical models using statistical
"relationships in global observations of sea level and air temperature (Ramstorf 2007, Ramstorf"
et al. 2011). The “low” scenario is based on the IPCC fourth Assessment model using
conservative assumptions about future greenhouse gas emission (the B1 scenario). The science
12
team that developed the scenarios for the National Climate Assessment (Parris et al. 2012),
"indicated the high scenario should allow assessment of risk from limited ice sheet loss, while",
the low scenario represents risk primarily from ocean warming.,
Using the National Climate Assessment sea level rise scenarios modified for conditions in,
"Virginia, we recommend anticipating a sea level rise in Virginia of approximately 1.5 feet over",
the next 20 to 50 years.,
Consequences for Recurrent Flooding in Virginia,
Considering the projections for all of the factors that drive recurrent flooding in Virginia –,
"precipitation, storm frequency, and sea level rise – the frequency and severity of flooding",
events is only likely to increase.,Sea level rise will make it easier for the current patterns of
weather events to generate damaging flood events in the future. Increases in storm intensity,
"and/or frequency will only aggravate that circumstance. For these reasons, serious",
consideration of adaptation options should be a priority.,

projections complicates the decision making process and makes choosing the right planning,
horizon critical (IWR 2011). Preparing for the worst case may result in significant over,
"expenditures, while under expenditures could lead to avoidable catastrophic consequences.",
"In looking at projected flood issues and adaptation strategies in Asia, The World Bank (2010)",
used a 40-year planning horizon because they felt this appropriately reflected city-level,
planning horizons and the typical time frame for major flood protection measures. This is,
"similar to the general planning horizon used in the Netherlands, which is 50 years. The",
rationale for the 50 year planning horizon is to minimize uncertainty in sea level rise,
"projections, while still using a long enough time frame for the investment required in large",
flood protection measures.,
Multiple planning horizons and “Adaptive Deltamanagement” is used in the Netherlands,
(http://www.deltacommissaris.nl/english/topics/adaptive_deltamanagement/) to help,
minimize the impacts of uncertainty. This requires taking short term measures that tie into,
long term measures. Working with multiple strategies on different time scales is a flexible,
approach which allows for switches in management with changing conditions. This allows them,approach which allows for switches in management with changing conditions. This allows them
to postpone major works until they have increased confidence in the climate change,

in conjunction with the property owners will increase chances of successful adoption of,
adaptation strategies.,
Multiple strategies approach and Flexible adaptation pathways,
Two of the most important lessons that can be learned from a review of global adaptation,
strategies are that a multi-layered approach to flood prevention is most effective and that,
"when predictions of the future are uncertain, flexible plans for adaptation are imperative.",
,38
Using multiple strategies to reduce flood damage is a comprehensive approach that builds a
"certain level of redundancy into the protection system. In the Netherlands, there has recently"
been a shift in the core element of their flood damage reduction plans from protection to risk
management (Councils for the Environment and Infrastructure 2010). This is a more
comprehensive approach that seeks to manage flood consequences (e.g. development in the
"floodplain) as well as provide protection from floods. Therefore, it necessitates the use of"
"multiple strategies, such as taking into account the probability of a flood, spatial planning, and"
"disaster mitigation (emergency services) This approach, while more comprehensive, also"
necessitates a great deal of coordination and cooperation among different agencies and
entities (van den Heuval et al 2011) .
Because no adaptation strategy (other than abandonment) completely removes the risk of
"flood damage, multi-level adaptation strategies allow states to decide on priorities (typically"
"protection, but can be management and planning) and then to “buy-down” the remaining risk"
"using other strategies. These can be visualized as a staircase, in which each step results in some"
"reduction in risk. In this approach, a storm surge barrier might be the initial adaptation, and"
other adaptations would include elevating structures and investing in emergency management
"(both to reduce consequences of a levee failure). Each step would reduce risk to some extent,"
together resulting in lower risk than any single measure. In areas with low-intensity
"development and little money for adaptations, the initial step might be stringent regulations on"
new development to keep it away from floodplains and additional steps might be an early
warning system and a detailed evacuation plan. Good plans should include some consideration
"of protection, spatial planning/management and emergency services."
"In most cases, adaptation measures will require significant investment, making it imperative to"
conduct rigorous assessments of cost- and flood reduction effectiveness. But calculation of
future risk is uncertain (due to inherent uncertainty in the timing and extent of climate change
"impacts), emphasizing the need for development of Flexible Adaptation Pathways (LeBlanc and"
"Linkin 2010). These are pathways that are that are low regret, reversible, or incorporate"
margins of error.
"An example is the Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) Plan, which contains a schedule of alternate"
"adaptation options, triggered by changes in 10 flood-risk parameters (Wilby and Dessai 2010)."
"Because there is uncertainty attached to estimates of each of these parameters, the plan is"
"phased, with the first phase being maintenance of existing defenses, the second phase being"
replacement of existing defenses and new structures waiting until the third phase (Wilby and
"Dessai 2010). This allows the plan to change (e.g. alterations to new defenses, no new"
"defenses, or acceleration of the phases) if conditions change from projected. Flexible"
39
"Adaptation Pathways are also being considered in New York City, NY (Rosenzweig and Solecki"
2010).
Lessons Learned
Flood issues and potential should be considered as an integral part of locality and
state planning
"As urban areas grow and expand, flood-considerate planning efforts can ameliorate existing"
flood issues while preventing new ones. Future development should be planned away from
hazard areas and long-term plans should be made for the retirement of infrastructure in
vulnerable areas.
Decision-making should occur within a watershed framework and include social
considerations
"Political boundaries typically only include portions of a watershed, making it impossible to solve"
flood issues without cooperation and coordination between localities.
Improve the knowledge base regarding changes in future flood potential
"Studies to predict changes in development patterns, economic growth, storm surge, sea level"
rise and precipitation patterns should be encouraged to ensure that rational long-term planning
can occur.
"Targeted, city/locality specific solutions that combine all three forms of adaptation are"
required
"Adaptations measures need to be designed based on the unique setting of each locality,"
incorporating local causes of flooding and social and economic characteristics.
Combining hard and soft infrastructure can protect while adding to quality of life
"Parks and other green spaces can beautify and contribute recreational value, while serving as"
"water storage areas. Marsh creation and beach nourishment result in recreational areas, are"
economic assets and provide flood protection.
State wide assessments of flood risk help move towards solutions
"When available funding is limited, state-wide prioritization of flood issues can help localities"
address problems in a logical fashion.
Solutions should be flexible to allow for new understandings of risk
"Overtime, changing conditions (populations, development and climate) change the challenges"
faced in reducing flood risk. The essential challenge is to create management systems that take
"a long term view of the issues, but are flexible enough to work under changing conditions."
40
Effective public communication and emergency management should be an essential,
part of any management plan,
No flood protection scheme or set of schemes will completely remove the underlying risk.,
"Therefore, it is essential to emphasis public awareness and promote real-time communication","Therefore, it is essential to emphasis public awareness and promote real-time communication"
of risk so that the public can make informed decisions. A strong emergency management,
program will help mitigate the consequences of floods if they occur. In areas where flooding is,program will help mitigate the consequences of floods if they occur. In areas where flooding is
"rare, but potential consequences are high, regular drills of the emergency management",
procedures should be carried out.,

Existing Planning Authorities in Virginia That Include Flooding/Sea Level Rise,
Every Virginia locality is required to develop a long range land use plan and review those plans,Every Virginia locality is required to develop a long range land use plan and review those plans
every five years (Code of Virginia [Va. Code] § 15.2-2223):,
“The comprehensive plan shall be made with the purpose of guiding and accomplishing a,

persons with disabilities.”,
These plans usually have a 20-year planning horizon and the “probable future needs” clause,
above would logically include long range flooding and sea level rise adaptation planning.,
"In “Tidewater” localities (those localities with tidal waters, delineated at § 10.1-2001),",
comprehensive plans and zoning authorities are also required under the Chesapeake Bay,
"Protection Act to include water quality protection measures, including zones protected from",
disturbance along the shoreline (Va. Code § 10.1-2100).,These additional natural resource
planning requirements provide opportunities to discuss and plan for tidal flooding and sea level,planning requirements provide opportunities to discuss and plan for tidal flooding and sea level

"discussion of these inundation risks to suggest development policy, however.",
"Under Va. Code § 15.2-2223.2, localities in “Tidewater” Virginia starting in 2013 will need to",
include coastal resource management guidance in their comprehensive plans. This guidance,
"will be developed in part by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and, “The guidance shall",
identify preferred options for shoreline management and taking into consideration the,
,41
"resource condition, priority planning, and forecasting of the condition of the Commonwealth's"
shoreline with respect to projected sea-level rise.” (Va. Code § 28.2-1100.9) This new
requirement should provide more detail and depth to the evaluation of inundation and sea
level rise impacts in tidal localities in Virginia.
In order for a locality in Virginia to be eligible for programs under the Federal Emergency
"Management Agency (FEMA), a community must undertake hazard mitigation planning (Title 44"
"Code of Federal Regulations [C.F.R.], Chapter 1, Part 201.3). The community must also have a"
floodplain management program and appropriate building ordinances in high-risk flood zones
in order to qualify for the National Flood Insurance Program [NFIP] (44 C.F.R. Subchapter B).
The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation is the lead agency on floodplain
management planning (Va. Code § 10.1-602).
These FEMA-required programs are natural places to start local government planning for
inundation and sea level rise impacts. Federal regulations allow localities to exceed the
"stringency of minimum federal standards, allowing for location-specific sea level rise adaptation"
strategies. Discounts in NFIP rates can be obtained by going beyond minimum federal and state
"requirements and some communities (Gloucester County, Chesapeake) are using committees of"
citizens to help plan those additional steps. Many hazard mitigation plans in Virginia include
sea level rise discussions (e.g. City of Poquoson 2008). Other localities are including sea level
"rise in their floodplain management plans (Gloucester 2008, Portsmouth 2010)."
The US Department of Transportation requires states (23 CFR § 450.206) and regions (23 CFR §
450.306) to complete long range transportation plans prior to receiving federal transportation
funding and these plans require extensive public notice and participation opportunities. In
"shoreline communities, inundation of transportation segments with sea level rise/storm surges"
is a long-range risk that should be included in these plans.
The current Virginia long-range transportation plan has a section discussing climate change
"impacts including sea level rise, although there are no recommendations for acting on those"
"projected impacts. On September 24, 2012, the Federal Highway Administration announced"
"federal cost-sharing would be available for “activities to plan, design, and construct highways to"
adapt to current and future climate change and extreme weather events.”
The US Department of Commerce requires a regional Comprehensive Economic Development
Strategy (CEDS) prior to being eligible for many Commerce funding programs (Title 42 United
States Code [U.S.C.] § 3162). These regional plans are another opportunity for climate change
"planning to take place. The Hampton Roads, Virginia CEDS (Vision Hampton Roads) mentions"
climate change/sea level rise as part of the economic challenge facing the region.
42
"The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) authorizes state coastal zone programs, such as"
"Virginia’s, and requires that it prepare a management program for its coastal zone (16 U.S.C. §"
1455.) This program must include a number of assessments of the natural resources in that
"zone. In addition, a Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program must be developed (16 U.S.C."
§ 1455b.) Grants are provided to eligible coastal states in response. This state planning and
reporting process provides opportunities for shoreline flooding and sea level rise adaptation
planning.
The CZMA language specifically mentions sea level rise as an element of concern at Title 16
"U.S.C. § 1451, “(l) Because global warming may result in a substantial sea level rise with serious"
"adverse effects in the coastal zone, coastal states must anticipate and plan for such an"
"occurrence.” In response, the Virginia CZM program in 2008 funded three regional planning"
districts to undertake climate change/sea level rise planning. It is continuing this work with
shoreline resiliency planning activities.
The US Fish and Wildlife Service requires each state and territory to prepare a Wildlife Action
Plan in order to receive funding under the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program and
the State Wildlife Grants Program (16 U.S.C. § 669e). The Wildlife Action Plans present a
strategy for meeting critical wildlife conservation needs in a state. The plans are periodically
"updated, providing an ongoing opportunity for involvement. There is voluntary guidance for"
states to include climate change in their plans and Virginia’s Wildlife Action Plan has an
appendix that includes habitat adaptation to climate change impacts such as sea level rise.
Virginia requires localities to submit water supply plans (Va. Code § 62.1-44.38:1). Given the
"potential threats to coastal water supplies from sea level rise impacts, these plans can be used"
in adaptation planning. Since some coastal communities are already experiencing salt water
"intrusion on their well systems, this authority becomes a useful tool for future planning"
activities.
Planning Authorities That Could Include Flooding/Sea Level Rise in Virginia
The Clean Water Act requires municipalities to have a storm water management plan (42 CFR §
122.26). Given projections of increased flooding due to sea level rise and increased storm
"intensity, this planning process should be a place where local governments start sea level rise"
adaptation planning. The Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System Management Program (MS4)
requires regional or watershed plans developed with public input (33 U.S.C. 1251 §402) (4
Virginia Administrative Code [V.A.C.] 50-60-90) and provides an opportunity for including
inundation and sea level rise impacts.
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development requires a consolidated plan prior to a
locality receiving HUD housing funding (24 CFR Part 91). This planning process is another tool
43
"for sea level rise adaptation planning, especially when using federal funds to place housing",
along tidal shorelines.,

and shoreline buffers under permanent easements allowing inundation. Buffers must be at,
least 35 feet wide.,
Keeping development and redevelopment out of areas at high risk of inundation is essential.,
Transfer of development rights is a process whereby the rights to develop a parcel (in an area,
,44
where a locality wants to discourage development and redevelopment) are transferred to
another parcel (where this development is preferred). This tool is used to preserve open space
or protect natural resources and could be a way of keeping development out of inundation
zones while allowing property owners to recoup some of their investment. Virginia allows
localities to authorize the transfer of development rights at Code of Virginia § 15.2-2316.2.
Owners of developed land in areas of high risk of inundation have vested rights in the current
"land use, a land use that may be increasingly at risk with sea level rise. Amortizing those vested"
rights over time – in a phase out period – allows the landowner to recoup investment but
moves those nonconforming land uses out of high risk inundation zones over time. Courts have
recognized a reasonable amortization period as preventing a “takings” claim wherein the
property owner seeks full compensation for the loss of the higher use of their land. Vested
rights are discussed at Code of Virginia § 15.2-2307.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) operates the National Flood Insurance
"Program (NFIP), a significant economic force in shoreline areas at risk from inundation, with"
flood insurance required in high flood risk zones. Eligibility for the NFIP is already conditioned
on a locality undertaking a number of adaptation measures for existing flooding risks (see both
"planning and regulatory sections). If properly focused on sea level rise inundation, this program"
could create additional incentives directed at adaptation to sea level rise risk. A federal study
"was recently completed to determine the impacts of climate change on the NFIP and, while not"
"released, is reported to estimate a 40 to 45 percent increase in mandatory coverage with sea"
"level rise projections. In addition, the recently enacted reauthorization of the NFIP requires a"
study on how FEMA would include projections of sea level rise into their flood rate insurance
maps.
"Virginia, like all states, regulates the private insurance industry. Insurance cost and availability"
"sends a strong market signal to areas with high risk of inundation, and as insurance companies"
"set rates and determine availability, these decisions will affect adaptation responses. With"
"more expensive insurance and/or limited availability, property and business owners in high risk"
"zones may seek other, safer areas to live and operate businesses or may seek insurance policies"
"that reward adaptation. At present, private sector providers of wind insurance have begun to"
limit coverage in coastal areas in Virginia or have withdrawn completely from some areas. If
"these actions continue, they may begin to shape investment patterns along the tidal shoreline"
"in Virginia and create a new set of financial incentives/disincentives. Conversely, state action to"
moderate these price signals along the shoreline could reverse needed adaptation measures.
"In areas of high risk from inundation, expenses will rise to provide public services necessary to"
maintain current land uses and landowner expectations. When those costs increase to
"significant levels, local government budgets may become compromised. One way to offset and"
45
properly apportion those expenses to properties requiring extra expenses would be through
the use of a special taxing district wherein residents in high risk zones are assessed a higher tax
"to pay for those services, sending a clear financial signal as well into those areas. Virginia Code"
at § 15.2-2400 allows the creation of local government special districts to accomplish certain
necessary tasks and could be used in high-risk inundation zones to create disincentives for land
uses at odds with higher risk from flooding and sea level rise.
Direct Investment and Infrastructure Decisions That Could Include Flooding/Sea
Level Rise
Each Virginia locality is authorized at Virginia Code §15.2-2239 to prepare a capital
improvement plan (CIP) to plan needed capital investments. The preparation of the CIP usually
occurs with comprehensive land use planning updates and offers a chance for inundation and
sea level rise impacts to be made part of local government infrastructure investment decisions.
"Placement of roads, schools, fire houses, police stations, and other public facilities are governed"
"by the CIP, and all these facilities need to account for sea level rise in coastal communities."
"At the federal level, projects built under the authority of the US Army Corps of Engineers"
"(USACE) Civil Works program, are required to take sea level rise into account, according to an"
"engineering guidance issued October 1, 2011. This guidance states, “Potential relative sea-level"
change must be considered in every USACE coastal activity as far inland as the extent of
estimated tidal influence.” The guidance and a web-based tool maintained by the USACE
outline the steps needed for all civil works infrastructure projects along the coastline.
"This policy is the only example of a prospective policy in federal and Virginia state authorities,"
one that anticipates a future state of inundation risk and sea level rise. It has been verified that
"the proposed port facility at Craney Island, developed with USACE involvement, does take"
modest sea level rise into account in its design.
Regulatory Authorities in Virginia that Could Include Flooding/Sea level Rise
"Programs exist at the local, state, and federal level to regulate development activities along the"
"tidal shoreline in Virginia, areas that are increasingly at risk from sea level rise and inundation."
Some of these authorities reside in local government zoning and building ordinances. Other
authorities place restrictions on development along these shorelines in order to protect the
natural ecosystem. These authorities can be used to keep the shoreline open and resilient and
better able to adapt to sea level rise. They can also be used to keep infrastructure and housing
out of shoreline areas that will be at increasing risk from sea level rise.
The strongest potential climate change adaptation regulatory tools are local zoning and building
code authorities since these govern the use of land and the placement of infrastructure along
the shoreline and also set minimum building safety and performance standards. Counties in
46
Virginia are given broad powers to protect the public health and welfare at Va. Code § 15.2-
1200. Counties are given general zoning authority at Virginia Code § 15.2-2280 and specific
authority to use zoning to “facilitate the provision of adequate...flood protection...” [§ 15.2-
2283 (iv)]. These local government zoning authorities have great potential for controlling
"development and redevelopment in high risk inundation zones, sending proper risk signals"
about shoreline development in the face of increased inundation risk due to sea level rise.
Localities have zoning and building code authorities granted to them by state and federal
statutes as well that can be used in flooding/sea level rise adaptation strategies. The
Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (Va. Code §10.1-2100/9VAC10-20) provides local
governments with tidal shorelines a number of land use authorities including “overlay districts”
along the shoreline within which development and redevelopment is restricted to protect
water quality. Local ordinances implement this statute and while there is a range of
"approaches, most localities require oversight and approval of any land disturbance"
"(development/redevelopment) in the “Resource Protection Area,” a zone extending 100 feet"
shoreward of the upper limits of the tidal wetlands.
A significant part of the Federal Emergency Management Administration’s (FEMA) National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) are floodplain ordinances necessary to implement local
floodplain management plans. FEMA requires local government floodplain zoning and building
code requirements (42 U.S.C. § 4001/ 44 CFR § 60.1) as a mandatory requirement prior to any
locality receiving federal flood insurance. This authority is overseen in Virginia by the
Department of Conservation and Recreation’s (DCR) floodplain management program (Va. Code
"§ 10.1-602), which suggests minimum local ordinances required to meet the FEMA/DCR"
requirements.
Floodplain management plans reach to local government ordinances and can require
"“freeboard,” a requirement that living space in a structure be at least a certain height above"
“base flood elevation” or the level of flooding expected from a once in 100-year flood.
"Currently in Virginia, there are at least 107 communities with 1- foot freeboards, which is"
"almost 40%. Seven communities have a 1.5-foot freeboard, four have a 2-foot freeboard, and"
four have 3-foot freeboard.
"Virginia, like most coastal states, has regulatory programs to protect its coastal and tidal"
estuarine ecosystem. Much river and tidal estuarine bottomland is state owned and
disturbance requires a permit from the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Development
"and redevelopment impacting mudflats, non-vegetated wetlands, and vegetated intertidal"
wetlands require a permit from federal regulators and state regulatory bodies. State authority
for wetlands protection is found at (9 VAC 25-210 /Va. Code §§ 62.1-44.15 and 62.1-44.15:20).
"For tidal wetlands, the primary state authority is given to the Virginia Marine Resources"

“The DEQ VWPP (Virginia Water Protection Permit) Program does not have the regulatory,

"the authority of the Clean Water Act have been made and, although the permits were not",
"issued, it is unclear whether the arguments regarding increased inundation risk and sea level",

Disturbance of primary coastal dunes requires a permit to insure that development does not,
encroach upon these dunes (Va. Code § 28.2-1408/4VAC20-440-10.). Development is allowed,encroach upon these dunes (Va. Code § 28.2-1408/4VAC20-440-10.). Development is allowed
"only within a zone 20 times the average shoreline recession rate over the last 100 years. Again,","only within a zone 20 times the average shoreline recession rate over the last 100 years. Again,"
an explicit inclusion of sea level rise in this authority would protect both the natural resource,
and discourage coastal development.,

The Virginia Department of Historic Resources (DHR) has a role to play in adaptation to,
"increasing inundation and sea level rise, since DHR approval must be granted before any",
disturbance/development can happen near an historic site (Va. Code § 10.1-2200/17VAC10).,
,48
Limitations on Adaptation Authorities,
The use of any of these authorities for adaptation to increased flooding/sea level rise is limited,The use of any of these authorities for adaptation to increased flooding/sea level rise is limited
"by two major factors. First, with adaptation authorities based on state statute there are",
"potential limitations caused by the fact that in Virginia, localities only have the authorities",
"specifically given to them by the state, a constitutional approach referred to as “Dillon’s Rule.”","specifically given to them by the state, a constitutional approach referred to as “Dillon’s Rule.”"
Virginia Courts have held that “municipal governments have only those powers which are,
"expressly granted by the state legislature, those powers fairly or necessarily implied from",
"expressly granted powers, and those powers which are essential and indispensable”",
"(Commonwealth v. County Board of Arlington County, 217 Va. 558, 575, 232 S.E.2d 30, 41",
(1977)).,
This limitation becomes a significant factor in looking at the authorities available to local,
governments to adapt to future changes in inundation along the tidal shoreline. At the,
"regulatory end of the approaches described above, as localities attempt to change",
"development and redevelopment patterns through zoning and building codes, their actions",
may be subject to a constitutional challenge under the Dillon rule.,While general authority
"exists for localities to protect the health and welfare of their citizens, specific actions taken to",
restrict development on private property raise a set of issues that may need to be settled in,
"court, unless specific legislative authority is granted.",
"Second, all but one of the authorities outlined above share a significant challenge in",
anticipating future conditions since they use past conditions to predict the future and cannot,
anticipate changes beyond those past trends. With the exception of the US Army Corps of,
"Engineers Guidance, all of the statutes and regulations rely on a retrospective analysis of",
"flooding and sea level rise impacts. One-hundred year floodplains under FEMA programs, rates","flooding and sea level rise impacts. One-hundred year floodplains under FEMA programs, rates"
"of shoreline recession under the primary dune regulations, and all of the other regulatory",
analyses do not anticipate future conditions in their scope. Until these statutes and regulations,analyses do not anticipate future conditions in their scope. Until these statutes and regulations
"become prospective and look to future conditions, they are of little use in inundation and sea",

Section 2.4 Adaptation strategies appropriate for Tidewater Virginia,
"An appropriate strategy for the state of Virginia would be the adoption of a multi-level, flexible","An appropriate strategy for the state of Virginia would be the adoption of a multi-level, flexible"
"adaptation plan with specific roles for the state, localities and individuals. Continued",
partnership with federal programs would be beneficial. A potential plan for adaptation follows:,partnership with federal programs would be beneficial. A potential plan for adaptation follows:
Level 1 – State actions,
"The state would be primarily responsible for the construction of large structural protection,",
"road elevation, monitoring of changing water levels, sea level projections and investing in early","road elevation, monitoring of changing water levels, sea level projections and investing in early"
warning system/storm prediction capacity. The rational for state involvement in large,
structural protection projects is that property rights in Virginia extend to mean low water and,
,49
"our shorelines tend to have many, small perpendicular roads, so tide gates and storm surge"
barriers are likely to be a more appropriate strategy than levees for most areas. Island localities
"and areas with state-owned waterfront are exceptions, and may be appropriate for levees."
"Water bodies large enough to warrant structures may cross locality boundaries, making state"
"coordination appropriate. In addition, these structures are expensive and potentially out of"
reach of individual localities.
"To create a flexible adaptation plan, the state would need to look at flooding throughout"
"Tidewater Virginia and group issues into tiers: 1) Areas that need immediate attention, 2) Areas"
"that will be facing problems ~40 years from now (given current predictions), and 3) Areas that"
will be facing problems ~100 years from now (given current predictions). The plan would
"include a series of steps and time frames for each step, addressing the first tier in the first steps"
and then moving through the tiers in order. As the state continues to monitor sea level rise and
"flood issues, it could slow the time frames if sea level rise acceleration slowed or flooding"
decreased and accelerate them if flooding increased. The plan can include different pathways
depending on changes in population that might move an area from one tier to the next.
A state-wide road plan for road elevation could combine incremental elevation with routine
"maintenance, targeting areas that are predicted to be impacted by flooding. Again, if sea level"
"rises more slowly than predictions, the elevation portion of the program could be suspended"
with minimal effort.
Level 2 – Locality actions
The localities would be primarily responsible for implementing the management and spatial
planning actions to minimize future risk from flooding. This should be done on a locality level
"because each locality has a unique culture and geology, and likely a unique set of appropriate"
"management actions. Management actions should be “low regret” actions, allowing more"
flexibility under changing conditions. Localities would also maintain the emergency services as
part of the multi-level plan.
A comprehensive list of policy/management actions can be found in Section 4.1 (Dumais and
Ness 2011). Localities can use this list to help determine the best actions for their localities.
Specific suggestions for Virginia Beach and the Eastern Shore can be found at:
http://www.virginia.edu/ien/sealevelrise/regionalfocusgroups.html.
Level 3 – Individual actions
Individuals should be encouraged to use soft engineering strategies when protecting their
properties as these tend to retain ecological services and are typically “low-regret” options in
"the long term. Where possible, individuals should be educated regarding current and future"
50
flood risk prior to acquiring property or constructing new buildings and all buildings should be
constructed using current best practices for reducing potential for flood damage.

Stakeholders would like to see the state involved in the following ways:,Stakeholders would like to see the state involved in the following ways:
1),They would like the state to review state policies that encourage development in flood
,"prone areas. Specifically, they mentioned the changes in the state health codes that"
,allow engineered septic systems in areas that were previously unsuitable for use. Many
,"of these areas are flood prone; however, the localities feel that they do not have the"
,authority to deny development if the state will allow septic systems.
2),They would like the state to decide for the localities what rate of sea level rise to use for
,"planning purposes. Ideally, they would like the state to issue maps of sea level rise"
,impacts at different times in the future (for different planning windows). This would
,give localities defined boundaries for planning efforts.
3),They are concerned how communities (especially rural ones) will finance adaptation
,strategies. They would like to see state leadership on this issue.
4),They would like to see the state (through the Virginia Department of Transportation)
,develop a comprehensive plan for the management of recurrently flooding roads. There
,"are concerns that as sea level rise makes flooding worse on coastal roads, the state will"
,"choose to abandon them, leaving the localities responsible for raising or maintaining the"
,roads.

"Stakeholders identified research, information and education as particular needs, especially in","Stakeholders identified research, information and education as particular needs, especially in"
regards to sea level rise predictions. They specifically mentioned:,
1),They see a need for more refined predictions of sea level rise. They would like to see
,this refinement on both a temporal and geographical scale. Due to differing rates of
,"local subsidence, relative sea level rise is slightly different throughout the state."
,Stakeholders would like the relative rates determined for each locality separately (but
,endorsed by the state; see above).
2),They see a need for better predictions of Nor’easter activity. Nor’easters cause a great
,deal of flooding issues in Virginia both through heavy precipitation and storm surge;
,"they tend to linger longer than hurricanes, contributing to longer flood episodes."
,"Therefore, being able to predict when Nor’easters are coming and understanding how"
,"Nor’easter activity is likely to change in the future should be as, or more, important than"
,predicating shifts in hurricane/tropical storm patterns.
3),"They see a need for increased education and outreach in all sectors. Specifically, they"
,"called out education and outreach to the public, and local and state decision makers as"
,being priorities.
4),They encourage economic and cost-benefit studies of do-nothing versus adaptation
,strategies followed by state prioritization of different strategies. There was some
,"discussion of how adaptation strategies should be funded (state versus local revenue),"
,and these considerations should be included as part of the economic studies.

Although some localities have done vulnerability analyses and prioritized areas for adaptation
"strategy adoption, at this time, there is no comprehensive analysis of coastal vulnerability."
"It is important to note that vulnerability is not a static measure, but will change over time. As"
"populations grow and new development continues, the magnitude of consequences from a"
"given flood event will change. In addition, sea level is predicted to rise faster in some parts of"
"Virginia, changing likelihood of flooding in certain areas relative to other areas. Therefore,"
some prediction of future conditions may help prioritize flooding adaptation efforts.
Predictions of future impacts: Changing precipitation and storm surge
Predictions of changes in precipitation are a complicated subject because they have two
"components, one is the number of storms that occur and the other is the intensity of the"
"storms. In Virginia, both tropical systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) and extratropical"
systems (nor’easters and winter storms) can drop significant amounts of precipitation in a short
time period.
"Both types of storm systems also create storm surge, the primary component of coastal"
"flooding. Storm surge is affected by storm intensity, size, speed, central pressure, angle of"
"approach, shape of the coastline, slope of the offshore area and the complexity of the shoreline"
"(inlets, bays, etc.) This means every storm produces a unique storm surge, making them"
"difficult to model and predict. On the open coast, fast moving storms tend to produce a higher"
87
"surge, while in bays and sounds, slower storms produce higher surges. In Virginia, nor’easters"
"arguably have a larger storm surge impact because they tend to move slowly, raising water"
"levels over multiple tidal cycles (Davis and Dolan 1993), while hurricanes storm surges create"
the most flooding when they coincide with high tide. Models suggest that for small to
"moderate storms, storm surge increases about 30 cm per 10mb pressure, while for large"
"storms, storm surge increases about 40 cm per 10mb pressure (Westerrink et al. 1992)."
Trends in both high intensity precipitation and storm surge are complicated by the fact that
weather patterns tend to follow cycles. This means that a short dataset may show an
increasing or decreasing trend in a weather pattern while a longer dataset may suggest a cyclic
pattern. The best information can be gathered from datasets long enough to show multiple
cycles. These datasets can be analyzed to see if the cycles themselves appear to be trending up
"or down. At this time, the understanding of climate controls on changing patterns of"
"storminess and storm surge are limited, reducing confidence in future projections of coastal"
storm impacts (Burkett and Davidson 2012).
Precipitation
"There are no clear trends in historic records of annual rainfall in Virginia, although it is predicted"
to increase by approximately 6% in Virginia (NCA 2012). Analyses of the 24-hour maximum
"rainfall frequency indicate an upward trend in coastal Virginia (Bonnin et al. 2006). However,"
"when considering flooding from precipitation, we are more concerned with the number of high"
"intensity rain events, rather than the total annual precipitation. High intensity rain events are"
typically the ones that lead to flooding. Scientists predict increasing storm intensity (leading to
"higher per storm precipitation), but the trend varies globally and even within the United States."
"Between 1948 and 2006, there appears to have been a 25% increase in the frequency of"
extreme precipitation events in Virginia (Madsen and Figdor 2007). Extending the dataset to
"2011, there appears to have been a 33% increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation"
"events, with the 1-year storm now occurring every 9 months (Madsen and Wilcox 2012). As the"
"frequency of extreme events has increased, so has the amount of rain that those storms"
"produce (i.e. the biggest storms are getting bigger), with Virginia seeing an 11% increase in"
precipitation from the largest storms between 1948 and 2011 (Madsen and Wilcox 2012).
This trend has implications for how we design our water management systems. Storm water
drainage systems are typically designed to handle storms of a certain frequency (e.g. a 2-year
storm design would handle storm water from a level of precipitation predicted to occur once
"every 2 years). As storm frequency increases, levels of precipitation that are currently expected"
only every five years will start to occur every two years. In the Virginia urban areas with
"combined sewer/stormwater systems, changes in storm intensity could have health and"
environmental impacts. The U.S. EPA estimates that sewer overflows discharge about one
88
trillion gallons of untreated stormwater containing human sewage every year (EPA 2004). This
suggests that new stormwater systems should be designed to handle larger storms than we are
currently experiencing.
"More research should be done on storm intensity trends in Virginia, so that we can incorporate"
these trends while planning our infrastructure.
Storm Surge
"Nor’easters typically move rapidly to the north and northeast past the coast of Virginia, but"
under favorable conditions in the general atmospheric circulation they can stall and intensify
with little forward motion for a couple of days (Ho et al. 1976). This can generate long lasting
storm surges. Research looking directly at storm surge data for the southeastern United States
"found a significant increasing trend in the number of moderately large storm surges, and 44 of"
the top 50 storm surge events between 1923 and 2008 were related to tropical storm activity
(Grinsted et al. 2012). Although tropical storms tend not to affect the system for as long as
extratropical storms they should be considered equally important drivers of flooding.
"Therefore, it is important to understand changes in both types of storm systems to predict"
"future flood events. However, the body of science addressing these topics is still actively"
"growing, making it difficult to predict future trends at this time."
Tropical storms
Much recent research has been done on the question of whether tropical storm activity is
increasing. Hurricane activity in the North Atlantic appears to have been increasing significantly
since 1995 (Nyberg et al. 2008) although the mechanism is unclear. Research on tropical
storms in the North Atlantic Basin suggest that there is an increase in storm activity in the 20 th
"century, but not necessarily an increase in storm intensity (i.e. proportion of hurricanes to"
tropical storms remain constant) (Holland and Webster 2007). It is also unresolved whether the
"increase in tropical storm activity is part of a cycle or is a return to normal hurricane activity,"
following a period of anomalously low activity in the 1970’s.
"Tropical storm activity has been linked to sea surface temperatures, El Niño, the North Atlantic"
"Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation among others, all of which are predicted"
to change over time (as cited in: Grinsted et al. 2012). The frequency of storms differs between
"warm and cold years, with the warm years having more storm activity, with the strongest effect"
on the largest storms (Grinsted et al. 2012). Trends suggest that Hurricane Katrina-size storms
are twice as frequent in warm years than in cold years (Grinsted et al. 2012). Determining
trends in storm activity is hampered by the changing observational and record keeping quality
"over time. Additionally, an increase in tropical storm activity in the North Atlantic Basin does"
not necessarily correlate with an increase in storms making landfall in Virginia.

Hampton Roads
Hampton Roads includes a large number of localities which vary greatly in both elevation and
"extent of development. Norfolk, Newport News, Portsmouth, Poquoson and Hampton are"
"highly developed localities, with extensive commercial and industrial development in Norfolk"
and Newport News. Virginia Beach and Chesapeake have both highly developed and pristine
areas. The remaining localities are considered less developed.
"Poquoson is considered highly vulnerable to sea level rise due to its elevation, which is entirely"
below 10-ft. Hampton and Norfolk both have substantial lands below the 10-ft elevation. Both
"Virginia Beach and Chesapeake have low land, vulnerable to sea level rise, but elevations are"
"higher in their most developed areas. Erosion is a threat, particularly along the oceanfront."
"The southern shore of the James River has high bluffs along much of its length, buffering the"
"effects of flooding from sea level rise, but still vulnerable to erosion. The northern shore tends"
to be lower elevation and flooding has been an issue as far up as Jamestown Island.
Middle Peninsula
Gloucester and Mathews counties have most of the low lying land in the Middle Peninsula
"region, and hence are the most vulnerable to sea level rise. Gloucester County is also the most"
developed of the Middle Peninsula localities. Most of its low lands are concentrated in a single
"area, Guinea Neck, where flooding on high tides is common. In Mathews County, low land is"
"dispersed and much of it is undeveloped. However, the northern portion of Mobjack Bay is"
"developed and is vulnerable to sea level rise. Although at relatively high elevations, Middlesex"
County is bayfront and therefore subject to erosion.
Northern Neck
"The Northern Neck has relatively high elevations, with only a few, small areas vulnerable to sea"
"level rise. The lowest community is Lewisetta, Northumberland County. Lewisetta is the only"
community vulnerable to inundation (in the next 100 years) along the Potomac River. It already
"experiences some tidal flooding of drainage ditches. However, portions of the Northern Neck"
are bayfront and subject to erosion.
Rappahannock Area
"Most of the Rappahannock area has relatively high elevation, and the major risk in this area is"
from increased erosion. Some of the lowest lying land in this area is owned by the military and
there are recreational beaches which may be vulnerable. Although the localities in this region
"are not highly developed, there is waterfront development along the rivers."
Northern Virginia
"This region is the northern-most area, located along the upper portion of the Potomac River."
This setting reduces expected wave energies thereby reducing erosion risk. Much of the
92
"Potomac River shoreline is owned by the National Park Service, and thus, is undeveloped"
(although the George Washington Memorial Parkway runs along the waterfront). There are
"two low lying areas prone to flooding, Old Towne, Alexandria and Belle Haven, Fairfax County."
These areas are the most vulnerable to sea level rise in the region.
Predictions of future impacts: Impacts of Sea Level Rise on infrastructure
There are three major threats to road systems from rising sea level: alterations to the drainage
"capacity, flooding of evacuation routes, increased hydraulic pressure on tunnels (Titus 2003)."
"Most roads have some type of drainage system, and in many low-lying areas roads are built at a"
lower elevation than the surrounding land to drain properties. These drainage systems rely on
"hydraulic head (from a slope to the waterway) to drain properly. As sea level rises, that slope"
"declines, decreasing the capacity of the drainage system. This can cause stormwater to back up"
"or pond, causing flooding. In areas subject to storm surge flooding, rising sea level may cause"
"the road to flood earlier, potentially cutting off evacuation routes. This requires that"
evacuation decisions be made earlier and can increase the risk to life. Roads and bridges can be
"raised as sea level rises, however, tunnels are relatively static constructions. Tunnels are used"
throughout Southside Virginia to ensure navigability of channels. If tunnel entrances cannot be
"raised, there is danger of flooding in the tunnels and a higher water table (due to sea level rise)"
results in increased hydraulic pressure on the tunnel structure (Titus 2003). Sea level rise is also
"predicted to increase coastal erosion. In coastal Virginia, many roads are adjacent to"
"waterways. Erosion of the shoreline adjacent to these roads puts the roads at risk of collapse,"
potentially cutting off access to portions of the road.
"Navigation is an important consideration for coastal Virginia, where port facilities and boat"
"traffic are a key part of the economic activity. Sea level rise will make channels deeper,"
allowing access to deeper draft vessels but will also reduce clearance under bridges (Titus
2003). Reduced clearance under bridges is unlikely to be a major problem in coastal Virginia
"due to the large number of drawbridges. However, sea level rise may be a problem for some"
port facilities and docks and piers where structures are built at an optimum height relative to
sea level (Titus 2003). How big of an issue sea level rise becomes for these structures depends
on the relationship between the rate of sea level rise and the expected lifespan of the
"structures. If the structures require renovations or rebuilding every 20-30 years anyway, new"
sea level heights could be taken into account at the time.
Other transportation at risk in Virginia includes airports and railroads. Reagan National Airport
"(located in Arlington, VA) has runways immediately adjacent to tidal waters. They are at risk"
from storm surge flooding and also at risk from Potomac River flooding. Sea level rise is
expected to exacerbate this problem and may shorten the runways (Titus 2003). Railroad lines
in coastal Virginia are used both for transportation and freight movement

losing some portion of their developed lands.

Predictions of future impacts: Impacts of Sea Level Rise on natural resources
Many of our coastal resources are critical components of a natural system to reduce coastal
"flooding impacts. Wide shallow water stretches break waves, reducing their energy before they"
"strike the shore. Beaches and marshes can act in the same way, protecting upland"
"development. Marshes can also absorb floodwaters and excess precipitation, reducing flood"
"duration, decreasing runoff “flashiness” and promoting groundwater recharge. Dunes act as"
natural levees and help prevent coastal erosion. Natural resources such as these are being
engineered throughout the world to reduce impacts of flood events (see Section II for more
detail).
"The potential value of these natural resources, and the costs associated with re-engineering"
"them once lost, argue for the importance of their preservation. However, these resources are"
"not only under threat from human development, but also from nature. Sea level rise and"
"coastal erosion eat away at the extent of marshes, beaches and shallow water areas."
Understanding the future distribution of these resources is critical to maintaining their services.
There are a few tools in existence that can be used to understand coastal processes and the
impacts to natural resources in Virginia. Descriptions of these tools follow.

Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)
SLAMM was designed to model the effect of long-term sea level rise on wetland conversion and
"shoreline modifications. It uses national datasets, such as NOAA tidal data, U.S. Fish & Wildlife"

of sea level rise and elevation data. Information about SLAMM can be found at:

the Accomack-Northampton Planning District Commission (2011). Hazard Mitigation Plan--The
Eastern Shore of Virginia. http://www.a-npdc.org/hazardplan.pdf). A typical regional hazard
"mitigation plan includes a hazard analysis, a vulnerability risk assessment, and a capability"
assessment. A few localities such as Chesapeake and Poquoson have their own plans but for the
most part the HMPs are regionally focused.
The IPCC (1990) recommendations for National Coastal Planning include four goals for local
"governments’ coastal planning efforts. First, coastal localities should implement comprehensive"
coastal zone management plans. Most of the hazard mitigation plans fail to address adverse
effects on the coastal zone due to land subsidence and sea level rise. Even far reaching plans
such as the City of Hampton’s Comprehensive Waterways Management Plan lack a
comprehensive study of current and probable future tidal flooding impacts in the city’s flood
prone areas. Still comprehensive coastal management plans need to extend beyond the
"borders of one locality and look at an entire watershed or region. In addition to the HMP, many"
"localities have comprehensive planning, disaster recovery plans, emergency operations plans,"
"floodplain management plans, stormwater management plans, green infrastructure plans, open"
"space management plans, and water supply plans, which hopefully will further the mitigation"
goals.
"Second, the IPCC recommends local governments identify coastal areas at risk. All of the hazard"
"mitigation plans do a thorough job identifying areas at risk, inventorying structures at risk and"
recognizing changing coastal hazards. IPCC also recommends localities should ensure that
coastal development does not increase vulnerability to flooding. The National Flood Insurance
Program’s main goal is to reduce flood damages and protect people and their property from
"unwise floodplain development through floodplain management regulations, which is"
reiterated in every hazard mitigation plan but some localities have passed more conservative
"regulations to restrict new development in vulnerable areas. Finally, according to IPCC’s"
"recommendations, emergency preparedness and coastal zone response mechanisms should be"
reviewed and strengthened. The hazard mitigation plans definitely focus on emergency
"preparedness mechanisms by addressing emergency alert systems, evacuation protocols and"
operations plans.
"The hazard mitigation plans predominately focus on risk assessments, which usually includes an"
"inventory of critical facilities, chronology of storm hazard events, and repetitive loss estimates"
"by locality but the exact methodology tends to vary by region. A typical risk assessment, such"
"as in Poquoson, evaluates the probability of occurrence, location, extent, magnitude and"
likelihood of a hazard for a given community. Whereas a vulnerability assessment estimates
the extent of injury and damage that may result from a hazard event of a given intensity.
Vulnerability assessments adjust for the fact that a hazard event that occurs in a highly
103
populated area will have a much higher impact than a comparable event that occurs in a
"remote, unpopulated area. Chesapeake performed the vulnerability assessment in two ways –"
first by estimating the potential impacts on structures in a given planning area in the event of a
100 year flood and then by estimating the per capita planning area damage. The Eastern Shore
"prioritized hazards based on the probability of past events, number of structures damaged,"
"primary impacts, secondary impacts and potential mitigation options. Whereas the George"
Washington Regional Comission completed community specific and regional hazard analyses as
well as community specific and regional vulnerability assessments. The Middle Peninsula
"created a series of maps for each locality showing the location of structures, on-site sewage"
"disposal systems, census block groups data and evacuation routes in Flood Zone A and in Flood"
Zone AE for the 100-year floodplain as well as the 500-year floodplain.
"All of the regions except the Eastern Shore, which calculated the loss estimation in-house,"
"utilized FEMA’s loss estimating software, Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard (HAZUS-MH) for their"
vulnerability assessment. The George Washington Region lists and maps all the critical facilities
in the 100-year floodplain for each locality. While very few plans show a digital overlay of the
"FEMA floodplain maps in relation to critical facilities, most quantified repetitive loss properties"
using the HAZUS flood model total annualized loss. HAZUS-MH was used to perform an
"elevated structures analysis for Poquoson which found a total of $64,228,000 dollars could be"
saved during a 100-year coastal flood as a result of elevating 567 structures; a 16-percent
reduction in loss (City of Poquoson and AMEC Earth and Environmental (2009). City of
Poquoson Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan.
http://www.ci.poquoson.va.us/sites/default/files/City%20of%20Poquoson%20FINAL%20to%20
FEMA%20RIII%20091409.pdf). The problem with HAZUS-MH is that it uses census data from
2000 which likely underestimates the amount of development in the coastal zone for all
localities.
"In addition to HAZUS, Southside Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia used a qualitative"
assessment based on a Priority Risk Index tool to measure the degree of risk for identified
"hazards in local communities. For Northern Virginia and Northern Neck, the Virginia Tech"
Center for Geospatial Information and Technology and VDEM developed a standardized
methodology to compare different hazards’ risk on a jurisdictional basis including parameters
"such as history of occurrence, vulnerability of people in the hazard area, probable geographic"
"extent of the hazard area, and historical impact in terms of human lives and property. Northern"
Virginia overlaid digital flood data with local parcel data and used it to perform a GIS-based risk
"assessment for critical facilities. In the future, all the localities that have GIS data layers such as"
"digital flood data, tax parcel records and building footprint data, could begin to estimate total"
building exposure in the 100-year floodplain.
104
Limitations
Virginia is still in the process of acquiring comprehensive light detection and ranging (LIDAR)
"data. These data will allow for more precise estimations of elevation, therefore improving the"
predictive capability of models. All of Coastal Virginia could greatly benefit from the availability
of LiDAR elevation data because LiDAR data will provide the resolution needed to map and
analyze storm water flooding issues in more detail.
"In general structural-loss estimates are based on best available data such as tax parcel,"
"structural characteristics of facilities, hazardous storage classifications, E911 building structures,"
"digital tax maps, census block information and construction type. but since this information"
"varies by locality, it limits the effectiveness of the regional hazard assessments. Each locality"
provided local critical facility and infrastructure data in some format but a comprehensive
inventory consistent across jurisdictions does not exist because there is not a universally
"accepted definition of what constitutes a critical facility. Structural inventories with elevation,"
high water marks and flood frequency data from all the localities could be very helpful in
preparing more accurate cost-benefit analyses but there continues to be a data gap in many of
the regions. Some plans underestimated the losses by treating all structures equally while some
"plans over estimate losses, by not taking into account which structures have been elevated or"
have had flood-proofing measures installed.
The Commonwealth of Virginia’s 2010 hazard mitigation plan ranking was based on the
National Climate Data Center (NCDC) database. A few regions used this same framework to
establish a common system for evaluating and ranking hazards. The majority of the data on
"historical weather-related events is from the Storm Event Database available from NCDC,"
whereas the numerical damage data and qualitative analysis are based on the collection of
"information reported by local offices of the NWS, as well as other local, State and Federal"
"agencies. Uncertainties are inherent in any loss estimation methodology, arising in part from"
incomplete scientific knowledge concerning specific hazards and their effects on the built
"environments, as well as incomplete datasets, approximations and simplifications of datasets"
"and relatively short time periods of records. As a result, inadequate information poses a"
problem for developing accurate loss estimates.
Hazards
Coastal flooding is the predominate threat throughout Tidewater Virginia; all regions stated
"flooding as a top priority. The majority of the flooding in all the regions is tidal flooding, which"
"primarily occurs in conjunction with coastal storms such as hurricanes, northeasters, and"
tropical storms but many regions are also subject to inland or riverine flooding. Most HMPs
distinguish between flooding caused by precipitation and coastal flooding hazards associated
"with hurricanes, tropical storms and nor'easters. Some plans such as Chesapeake, Richmond-"
105
"Crater and Poquoson analyze wind events (including tornadoes, hurricanes, nor'easters) as a"
separate hazard. Poquoson listed all the historical tropical storms and differentiated whether
"the historic event was caused by flooding, high winds or both. Shoreline erosion (which is"
"driven by a number of natural influences such as sea level rise and land subsidence, large"
"storms, storm surge, and flooding) is typically incorporated into the flood section."
Not all plans identified sea level rise as a hazard but certain regions such as Southside Hampton
"Roads, Northern Virginia, and Middle Peninsula have more information on the topic and explain"
why the hazard will pose a greater threat in the future. For the plans that acknowledge sea
"level rise, it is generally accepted that increased flooding damage will result from sea level rise."
After the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) created new hurricane
"storm surge maps for the coast of Virginia in 2007, the Northern Neck PDC created the"
Northern Neck Regional Coastal Storm Surge Hazard Assessment to quantify the monetary
impact to real estate improvements of a category 1 hurricane storm surge throughout a
county's coastline. There are many assumptions inherent in this analysis that have mostly to do
with limitations with the GIS datasets but it is still helpful in identifying storm surge problem
areas for Northern Neck localities. The analysis looked at the total assessed value of all
improvements that have at least some area within the storm surge area as well as the
percentage of the total value for only those portions of buildings within the storm surge area.
Middle Peninsula Storm Surge Hazard Maps were developed by the U.S. Corp of Engineers in
conjunction with the VDEM as part of their 2008 Virginia Hurricane Evacuation Study. VDOT and
County officials in the Middle Peninsula region identified specific flood prone roads in the 100-
year and 500-year floodplain maps. The storm surge maps overlaid the evacuation route with
tidal storm surge impacts for a few coastal counties in the Middle Peninsula. The data only
reflect salt water flooding even though freshwater flooding may also occur with hurricane
events from heavy rainfall runoff. The storm surge hazard maps identify areas that can be
"expected as the result of Category 1, 2, 3 and 4 hurricanes, based on the Sea, Lake and"
Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The SLOSH model is best used for defining the
“worst case scenario” of potential maximum surge for particular locations as opposed to the
regional impact of one singular storm surge event (Salter’s Creek Consulting (2011). Southside
Hampton Roads Hazard Mitigation Plan.
http://remtac.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Fdy2DLERy44%3d&tabid=346&mid=1709).
Capability and Mitigation
"A few regions completed a capability assessment of each jurisdiction's fiscal, administrative,"
"and technical capabilities. A review of existing plans, policies, programs, ordinances and staff"
expertise was completed to identify existing gaps within government activities that could
exacerbate a locality's vulnerability or hinder its ability to implement the hazard mitigation
106
"actions. By only looking at the local level, it becomes difficult to highlight the gaps that exist in"
the region as a whole but it tends to be easier for communities to review locality specific
strategies and determine their own mitigation activities than it is to implement multi-
jurisdictional planning. Many localities developed individual actions plans without holistically
developing cross-jurisdictional mitigation goals. Several of the plans such as George
"Washington, Northern Virginia and Southside include the same list of mitigation techniques,"
"sorted by prevention, property protection, natural resource protection, structural projects,"
"emergency services and public education, without customizing the strategies to be specific to"
the region. Both regions included the individual locality action plans and identified several
themes but only had a few overarching general goals.
Most of the HMPs generally aim to identify existing flood-prone structures that may benefit
from mitigation measures and encourage the incorporation of such techniques into new and
pre-existing development. The plans also support mitigation of priority flood-prone structures
using FEMA HMA programs but in general different regions prioritized mitigation strategies in
different ways and had different geographic scales. The City of Poquoson Municipal Code
includes the Floodplain Management Overlay District which prohibits new manufactured
homes in the Special Flood Hazard Areas. The ordinance requires the minimum height of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved buildings built in the floodplain to be at least
one foot above BFE (City of Poquoson and AMEC Earth and Environmental (2009)). Poquoson’s
"development standards require all new roads to be built at least 4.5 feet above mean sea level,"
all new pump stations to be built above the 100-year flood elevation and all new utilities below
the 100-year flood elevation are required to have watertight manhole lids.
Planning District Efforts
"Under a grant from the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program, several of the Planning"
District Commissions (PDC) have looked at the impacts of climate change on their localities.
One of the impacts considered is sea level rise. These reports are geospatially explicit and
provide local information about potential sea level rise impacts. Links to the reports can be
"found on the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program’s website, at:"

Section 4.2 GIS methodology
Existing state-wide models of elevation (or topographic) surfaces use DEMs (Digital Elevation
Models) developed from the Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP). DEMs have less vertical
"and horizontal resolution than newer techniques, which can result in over-estimating areas of"
potential inundation. More accurate LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data are still being
"collected for portions of the Tidewater Virginia region. Therefore, we built a new surface for"
"Tidewater Virginia, consisting of LiDAR data where available and DEMs in the few localities"
"where LiDAR are not yet available. The surface we created has the most recent, highest"
"resolution elevation data currently existing. Onto the newly created surface, we projected a"
"sea level rise of 1.5 feet and a storm surge of 4.5 feet (3 feet above sea level rise, considered a"
"reasonable surge for a large, but typical storm)."
Figure 10 shows the distribution of data type by locality. Most of the LiDAR data layers came
"referenced to North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD88), a standard geodetic vertical"
datum. Any data layers that were in a different vertical datum were converted to NAVD88
before using. A geographic information system (ArcGIS) was used to combine the data layers
"into seamless elevation surfaces for five regions: Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula, Peninsula,"
"Southside, and Eastern Shore. These highly detailed surfaces resulted in very large files,"
between 50 and 150 gigabytes for each dataset. This meant processing times were
"considerable, as much as 24 hours for each step in the procedure, with a minimum of 16 steps"
per region.
"In order to determine what land areas would flood, the elevation surfaces needed to be"
referenced to a tidal datum. We chose to reference our surfaces to present mean higher high
"water (MHHW), so our sea level rise and storm surge values represent water levels above this"
"reference. Using this adjustment, sea level rise is calculated from the highest point typically"
inundated daily. Adjusting from NAVD88 to MHHW involved using software developed by
"NOAA called VDatum, whose primary purpose is to convert elevation data between different"
vertical reference systems. The basic concept involves many elevation points along the
"shoreline being converted from NAVD88 to MHHW, and then extrapolated inland. The"
adjusted surface used in this analysis was provided by NOAA’s Coastal Services Center. This
adjusted surface was subtracted from the NAVD88-referenced elevation surface to create a
MHHW-referenced elevation surface.
"Using the MHHW-referenced elevation surfaces for each region, all elevations less than or"
equal to 1.5 feet were extracted to represent the area flooded by this potential sea level rise.
Next all elevations greater than 1.5 and less than or equal to 4.5 feet were extracted to
represent the area flooded by a 3 foot storm surge on top of the 1.5 foot sea level rise. The
"areal extents of these two scenarios were overlain on three different elements: land use,"
108
"wetlands, and roads. The land use layer is from the Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP)"
"and was grouped into three major categories for this study: developed, agricultural, and"
"forested. The wetlands layer is from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), and the roads"
"layer is from TIGER/Line data from the US Census Bureau. The land use, wetlands, and roads"
"data were apportioned to each coastal locality for both scenarios, and are presented in the"
Table of Coastal Vulerability to Predicted Sea Level Rise and Storm Surge (see Section I).

Section 4.3 Sea Level Rise in Virginia
"From: Hershner, C. and M. Mitchell. 2012. Rising Tides, Sinking Coast: How Virginia’s coastal"
communities can adapt to surging sea levels. Virginia Issues and Answers 17(2):22-27.
Sea level rise in Virginia is a documented fact. Water levels in Hampton Roads have risen more
than one foot over the past 80 years. The causes of this rise are well understood and current
analyses suggest the rate of rise is increasing (Boon 2012; Ezer & Corlett 2012; Sallenger et al.
2012). The consequence of higher sea level is evident in the increased frequency of significant
"flooding events in coastal Virginia communities. In the face of increasing risks, adaptation is"
"essential, and need to act is immediate."
"Sea level in Virginia is affected by three general factors: the volume of water in the ocean, the"
"elevation of the Virginia shoreline, and the movement of water in the ocean. All three things"
have been changing in recent times. The result for coastal Virginia has been a long-term and
recently accelerating rise in the level of tidal waters in the Commonwealth.
The first factor – the volume of water in the ocean - is simple to understand. Increasing the
volume of water in the ocean will unavoidably raise the water level at the shoreline. Two things
"are currently causing the volume of ocean water to increase. Glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets"
"in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, adding water that was stored on land surfaces to the"
"ocean basins. At the same time, the water in the oceans is warming causing it to expand."
Together these processes are believed to have added over half a foot to ocean levels in the past
"century. Both of these processes have increased recently, and now are adding to the oceans’"
volume at about twice the former rate. Depending on how much the earth’s atmosphere
"warms, these rates are anticipated to increase even further."
The second factor – the elevation of Virginia’s shoreline – is surprising for many people living
here. It turns out that Virginia’s coast is sinking. Again there are a number of things causing
this. The primary cause is the continuing adjustment of the earth’s crust to the melting of
"glaciers from the last ice age. About 25,000 years ago, huge ice sheets extended from the"
North Pole all the way south to what is now northern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. These ice
"sheets were estimated to be over a mile thick, exerting tremendous pressure on the earth’s"
"crust, actually causing it to bulge up in the region of Virginia. As the ice sheet melted and"
"retreated northward, that pressure was released and the earth’s crust has been slowly"
readjusting ever since. The result is a slow sinking of the mid-Atlantic coastal region.
"In addition to the general subsidence of the region, there are two other more local processes"
that are adding to the general sinking of our land area. The first is the continuing compaction
of the materials that were blasted apart when a meteor struck the area near Cape Charles
"about 35 million years ago. Materials in the impact crater, which extends from the mouth of"
110
"the Rappahannock River to Virginia Beach, continue to settle and compact to this day. The",
"other process is even more localized, but adds significantly to the slow sinking of land in a",
number of areas. This is pumping of large volumes of deep groundwater. Two examples of the,number of areas. This is pumping of large volumes of deep groundwater. Two examples of the

ocean volume. At present sea level in southeastern Virginia is rising at a rate slightly greater,ocean volume. At present sea level in southeastern Virginia is rising at a rate slightly greater

understandings of global atmospheric processes indicate temperatures will continue to rise for,understandings of global atmospheric processes indicate temperatures will continue to rise for
at least the rest of the century. The uncertainty that exists is in how high they may go. At a,
"minimum this will sustain current trends in glacier and ice cap melting, as well as thermal",
expansion of ocean water. Indeed several independent recent analyses have detected,
acceleration in the rate of sea level rise from the mid-Atlantic to New England. What all this,
"means is that we will see higher sea levels in the future, they will probably rise more rapidly",
"than they have in the last century, and potentially they will rise much more rapidly.",
,111
"The long range, end-of-the-century forecasts have significant uncertainty, with projections for"
our region of a sea level rise anywhere between 1.5 and 7.5 feet. These projections are based
on the U.S. National Climate Assessment which has generated four scenarios of global sea level
for its 2013 report to Congress (Parris et al. 2012). By adding what we know about land
"subsidence in the Virginia coastal region, we are able to develop regional scenarios to inform"
planning and adaptation efforts. The scenarios are shown in Figure 16. They all begin with the
documented sea levels in 1992. The lowest curve (labeled “current”) represents a simple
extrapolation of the historic average rate of rise. The top curve (labeled “highest”) represents
the physically possible circumstance that would occur with rapid melting of all the earth’s
"glaciers and ice caps, essentially a worst case scenario. The middle two curves are based on"
models of the global system’s response to either significant efforts by the world’s nations to
"reduce greenhouse gases (the “low” curve), or business as usual (the “high” curve). Recent"
trends in Virginia sea levels suggest we are on the “high” curve. Whether this rate of increase
"will be sustained is uncertain, but it does inform thinking about the Commonwealth’s future."
"Given what is currently known, it seems reasonable to anticipate that sea level in Virginia will"
be 1.5 feet higher than it is presently sometime in the next 20 to 50 years. This is a time frame
that makes consideration of potential impacts relevant for home mortgages and most public
"infrastructure (e.g. roads, schools, fire stations)."
