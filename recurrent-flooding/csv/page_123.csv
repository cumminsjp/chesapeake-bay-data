Section 4.5 Emergency Manager Survey Responses
We obtained responses to our questions from 19 localities and 25 participants (note that City of
"Chesapeake, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach had more than one respondent representing their"
locality). Localities are list below; the ones with asterisks had at least one participant who
"responded to the survey, the number of respondents is in parentheses. Responses are graphed"
"below. Response should be considered the viewpoint of the respondent, since respondents"
from the same localities did not always respond in the same way. Responses from the Northern
Neck and Middle Peninsula Regional Emergency Manager Meeting (NN/MP) and the Regional
Emergency Management Technical Advisory Committee Meeting (REMTAC) are included in
"“ALL” responses, but have also been graphed separately to highlight any operational"
differences between the approaches of predominantly low development localities (NN/MP)
with predominantly high development localities (REMTAC).
