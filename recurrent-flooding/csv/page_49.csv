"Adaptation Pathways are also being considered in New York City, NY (Rosenzweig and Solecki"
2010).
Lessons Learned
Flood issues and potential should be considered as an integral part of locality and
state planning
"As urban areas grow and expand, flood-considerate planning efforts can ameliorate existing"
flood issues while preventing new ones. Future development should be planned away from
hazard areas and long-term plans should be made for the retirement of infrastructure in
vulnerable areas.
Decision-making should occur within a watershed framework and include social
considerations
"Political boundaries typically only include portions of a watershed, making it impossible to solve"
flood issues without cooperation and coordination between localities.
Improve the knowledge base regarding changes in future flood potential
"Studies to predict changes in development patterns, economic growth, storm surge, sea level"
rise and precipitation patterns should be encouraged to ensure that rational long-term planning
can occur.
"Targeted, city/locality specific solutions that combine all three forms of adaptation are"
required
"Adaptations measures need to be designed based on the unique setting of each locality,"
incorporating local causes of flooding and social and economic characteristics.
Combining hard and soft infrastructure can protect while adding to quality of life
"Parks and other green spaces can beautify and contribute recreational value, while serving as"
"water storage areas. Marsh creation and beach nourishment result in recreational areas, are"
economic assets and provide flood protection.
State wide assessments of flood risk help move towards solutions
"When available funding is limited, state-wide prioritization of flood issues can help localities"
address problems in a logical fashion.
Solutions should be flexible to allow for new understandings of risk
"Overtime, changing conditions (populations, development and climate) change the challenges"
faced in reducing flood risk. The essential challenge is to create management systems that take
"a long term view of the issues, but are flexible enough to work under changing conditions."
