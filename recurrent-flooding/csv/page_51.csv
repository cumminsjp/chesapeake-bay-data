"resource condition, priority planning, and forecasting of the condition of the Commonwealth's"
shoreline with respect to projected sea-level rise.” (Va. Code § 28.2-1100.9) This new
requirement should provide more detail and depth to the evaluation of inundation and sea
level rise impacts in tidal localities in Virginia.
In order for a locality in Virginia to be eligible for programs under the Federal Emergency
"Management Agency (FEMA), a community must undertake hazard mitigation planning (Title 44"
"Code of Federal Regulations [C.F.R.], Chapter 1, Part 201.3). The community must also have a"
floodplain management program and appropriate building ordinances in high-risk flood zones
in order to qualify for the National Flood Insurance Program [NFIP] (44 C.F.R. Subchapter B).
The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation is the lead agency on floodplain
management planning (Va. Code § 10.1-602).
These FEMA-required programs are natural places to start local government planning for
inundation and sea level rise impacts. Federal regulations allow localities to exceed the
"stringency of minimum federal standards, allowing for location-specific sea level rise adaptation"
strategies. Discounts in NFIP rates can be obtained by going beyond minimum federal and state
"requirements and some communities (Gloucester County, Chesapeake) are using committees of"
citizens to help plan those additional steps. Many hazard mitigation plans in Virginia include
sea level rise discussions (e.g. City of Poquoson 2008). Other localities are including sea level
"rise in their floodplain management plans (Gloucester 2008, Portsmouth 2010)."
The US Department of Transportation requires states (23 CFR § 450.206) and regions (23 CFR §
450.306) to complete long range transportation plans prior to receiving federal transportation
funding and these plans require extensive public notice and participation opportunities. In
"shoreline communities, inundation of transportation segments with sea level rise/storm surges"
is a long-range risk that should be included in these plans.
The current Virginia long-range transportation plan has a section discussing climate change
"impacts including sea level rise, although there are no recommendations for acting on those"
"projected impacts. On September 24, 2012, the Federal Highway Administration announced"
"federal cost-sharing would be available for “activities to plan, design, and construct highways to"
adapt to current and future climate change and extreme weather events.”
The US Department of Commerce requires a regional Comprehensive Economic Development
Strategy (CEDS) prior to being eligible for many Commerce funding programs (Title 42 United
States Code [U.S.C.] § 3162). These regional plans are another opportunity for climate change
"planning to take place. The Hampton Roads, Virginia CEDS (Vision Hampton Roads) mentions"
climate change/sea level rise as part of the economic challenge facing the region.
