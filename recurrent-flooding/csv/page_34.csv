,Pros:,
,o,Effective in urban areas where these types of structures already exist and
,,stormwater is already being collected and channeled
,o,Reduces water volume downstream
,o,Can be used as urban solutions (parking garage) during normal flow time
,Cons:,
,o,Requires a strategy for safely draining the storage area afterwards and
,,preventing disease carrying organisms from growing in the stored water
,o,"When using parking garages, must have alternative parking arrangements during"
,,flood events and a notification system
,o,Collection of large amounts of stormwater can concentrate pollutants found in
