Sea Level
"Sea level refers to the average level of tidal waters, generally measured over a 19-year period."
The 19-year cycle is necessary to smooth out variations in water levels caused by seasonal
weather fluctuations and the 18.6-year cycle in the moon’s orbit. The sea level measured at a
particular tide gauge is often referred to as local mean sea level (LMSL) (Titus et al. 2010).
Storm Surge
"Storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted"
astronomical tide. It is caused primarily by the winds from a storm and is linked to both tropical
and extratropical storms.
Storm Tide
Storm tide is the water level rise during a storm due to the combination of storm surge and the
astronomical tide.
Vulnerability
"Vulnerability is the potential for damage to individuals, society and the environment. It can be"
reduced through the use of adaptation strategies.
