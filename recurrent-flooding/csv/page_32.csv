,Examples: This is a common strategy used throughout the world and throughout,
,Virginia. Almost all beach towns have some percentage of homes which have been,

,difficult to finance if a property has not experienced any flooding and the property,
,owner is attempting to be proactive.,
,Pros:,
,o,"Protects homes, vehicles, and people by raising them above flood levels"
,o,Relatively inexpensive compared to other engineering strategies (for a few
,,houses)
,o,Particularly cost effective on new construction where the costs of elevation can
,,be rolled into the mortgage.
,Cons:,
,o,Effectiveness is reduced when a greater than anticipated storm surge occurs
,o,"Not future-proof, when sea level rises the relative gain in elevation declines"
,o,"Does not protect cars or boats, which are typically parked under the house"
,o,Must raise HVAC and electrical systems with the house to be effective
,o,"It only protects the structures that have been elevated, in heavily populated"
,,areas elevating all the structures may be cost prohibitive
,o,Social implications as elevated houses may be difficult to access
,o,May be difficult to obtain loans for this type of improvement project
