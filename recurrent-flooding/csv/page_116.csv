"actions. By only looking at the local level, it becomes difficult to highlight the gaps that exist in"
the region as a whole but it tends to be easier for communities to review locality specific
strategies and determine their own mitigation activities than it is to implement multi-
jurisdictional planning. Many localities developed individual actions plans without holistically
developing cross-jurisdictional mitigation goals. Several of the plans such as George
"Washington, Northern Virginia and Southside include the same list of mitigation techniques,"
"sorted by prevention, property protection, natural resource protection, structural projects,"
"emergency services and public education, without customizing the strategies to be specific to"
the region. Both regions included the individual locality action plans and identified several
themes but only had a few overarching general goals.
Most of the HMPs generally aim to identify existing flood-prone structures that may benefit
from mitigation measures and encourage the incorporation of such techniques into new and
pre-existing development. The plans also support mitigation of priority flood-prone structures
using FEMA HMA programs but in general different regions prioritized mitigation strategies in
different ways and had different geographic scales. The City of Poquoson Municipal Code
includes the Floodplain Management Overlay District which prohibits new manufactured
homes in the Special Flood Hazard Areas. The ordinance requires the minimum height of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved buildings built in the floodplain to be at least
one foot above BFE (City of Poquoson and AMEC Earth and Environmental (2009)). Poquoson’s
"development standards require all new roads to be built at least 4.5 feet above mean sea level,"
all new pump stations to be built above the 100-year flood elevation and all new utilities below
the 100-year flood elevation are required to have watertight manhole lids.
Planning District Efforts
"Under a grant from the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program, several of the Planning"
District Commissions (PDC) have looked at the impacts of climate change on their localities.
One of the impacts considered is sea level rise. These reports are geospatially explicit and
provide local information about potential sea level rise impacts. Links to the reports can be
"found on the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program’s website, at:"
