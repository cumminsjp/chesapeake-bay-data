"Technical Advisory Committee (A Hampton Roads Regional group)). At both meetings, we gave"
a presentation about the flooding study and then asked the emergency managers in attendance
to respond to some questions. We sent the same set of questions to the other emergency
manager meetings that had members from Tidewater Virginia.
"A list of all the localities that responded to the survey, and the survey questions and answers"
can be found in Section 4.5: Emergency Manager Survey Responses.
Almost all respondents said that they were aware of roads that must be closed or signed for
"flooding issues, which concurs with VDOTs road flooding data (see Precipitation flooding: Road"
"Closures, Section 4.1). Nearly half of respondents say areas flood during normal high tides and"
nearly 3⁄4 say that areas flood during extreme high tides. All but 3 respondents claim that some
portion of their locality floods during large storms. This indicates that flooding is a widespread
problem.
Localities are addressing flooding issues. Most emergency managers were aware of locality
plans that dealt with some aspect of flooding issues and claimed that critical infrastructure
inside of flooding areas had been identified. Most localities have considered some type of
adaptation strategy to address flooding. Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula localities
considered elevating road surfaces and raising structures as the primary adaptation strategies.
These localities tend to have populations that are relatively spread out and roads with little
associated infrastructure (e.g. stormwater drainage systems). The Regional Emergency
Management Technical Advisory Committee (REMTAC; composed of Hampton Roads localities)
"localities considered a wide variety of adaptations, including (in order of popularity): raising"
"structures, relocating people, elevating road surfaces and sea walls, and pumping"
"stations/dams/levees. Pumping stations, dams, and levees are expensive engineering"
strategies and therefore are most likely to be considered in areas where concentrated
"development allows for each engineering structure to protect a large number of properties,"
bringing the cost per property down.
"Despite the fact that flooding is an issue for almost all respondent localities, less than 1/3 saw"
"sea level rise as contributing to their flooding issues. However, most of them were interested in"
learning more about the impacts of sea level rise in their localities.
"Flooding has been observed in all of Virginia’s coastal localities, but assessing the magnitude of"
past issues is constrained by lack of compiled data.
Where can flooding be expected?
The risk of flooding can be assessed by examining detailed information about land elevation
"and proximity to water. In recent years, this type of analysis has been done for a variety of"
