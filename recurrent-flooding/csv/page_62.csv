regards to sea level rise predictions. They specifically mentioned:,
1),They see a need for more refined predictions of sea level rise. They would like to see
,this refinement on both a temporal and geographical scale. Due to differing rates of
,"local subsidence, relative sea level rise is slightly different throughout the state."
,Stakeholders would like the relative rates determined for each locality separately (but
,endorsed by the state; see above).
2),They see a need for better predictions of Nor’easter activity. Nor’easters cause a great
,deal of flooding issues in Virginia both through heavy precipitation and storm surge;
,"they tend to linger longer than hurricanes, contributing to longer flood episodes."
,"Therefore, being able to predict when Nor’easters are coming and understanding how"
,"Nor’easter activity is likely to change in the future should be as, or more, important than"
,predicating shifts in hurricane/tropical storm patterns.
3),"They see a need for increased education and outreach in all sectors. Specifically, they"
,"called out education and outreach to the public, and local and state decision makers as"
,being priorities.
4),They encourage economic and cost-benefit studies of do-nothing versus adaptation
,strategies followed by state prioritization of different strategies. There was some
,"discussion of how adaptation strategies should be funded (state versus local revenue),"
,and these considerations should be included as part of the economic studies.
