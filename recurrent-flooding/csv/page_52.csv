"The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) authorizes state coastal zone programs, such as"
"Virginia’s, and requires that it prepare a management program for its coastal zone (16 U.S.C. §"
1455.) This program must include a number of assessments of the natural resources in that
"zone. In addition, a Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program must be developed (16 U.S.C."
§ 1455b.) Grants are provided to eligible coastal states in response. This state planning and
reporting process provides opportunities for shoreline flooding and sea level rise adaptation
planning.
The CZMA language specifically mentions sea level rise as an element of concern at Title 16
"U.S.C. § 1451, “(l) Because global warming may result in a substantial sea level rise with serious"
"adverse effects in the coastal zone, coastal states must anticipate and plan for such an"
"occurrence.” In response, the Virginia CZM program in 2008 funded three regional planning"
districts to undertake climate change/sea level rise planning. It is continuing this work with
shoreline resiliency planning activities.
The US Fish and Wildlife Service requires each state and territory to prepare a Wildlife Action
Plan in order to receive funding under the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program and
the State Wildlife Grants Program (16 U.S.C. § 669e). The Wildlife Action Plans present a
strategy for meeting critical wildlife conservation needs in a state. The plans are periodically
"updated, providing an ongoing opportunity for involvement. There is voluntary guidance for"
states to include climate change in their plans and Virginia’s Wildlife Action Plan has an
appendix that includes habitat adaptation to climate change impacts such as sea level rise.
Virginia requires localities to submit water supply plans (Va. Code § 62.1-44.38:1). Given the
"potential threats to coastal water supplies from sea level rise impacts, these plans can be used"
in adaptation planning. Since some coastal communities are already experiencing salt water
"intrusion on their well systems, this authority becomes a useful tool for future planning"
activities.
Planning Authorities That Could Include Flooding/Sea Level Rise in Virginia
The Clean Water Act requires municipalities to have a storm water management plan (42 CFR §
122.26). Given projections of increased flooding due to sea level rise and increased storm
"intensity, this planning process should be a place where local governments start sea level rise"
adaptation planning. The Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System Management Program (MS4)
requires regional or watershed plans developed with public input (33 U.S.C. 1251 §402) (4
Virginia Administrative Code [V.A.C.] 50-60-90) and provides an opportunity for including
inundation and sea level rise impacts.
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development requires a consolidated plan prior to a
locality receiving HUD housing funding (24 CFR Part 91). This planning process is another tool
