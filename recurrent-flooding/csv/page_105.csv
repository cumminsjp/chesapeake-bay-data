Predictions of future impacts: Impacts of Sea Level Rise on natural resources
Many of our coastal resources are critical components of a natural system to reduce coastal
"flooding impacts. Wide shallow water stretches break waves, reducing their energy before they"
"strike the shore. Beaches and marshes can act in the same way, protecting upland"
"development. Marshes can also absorb floodwaters and excess precipitation, reducing flood"
"duration, decreasing runoff “flashiness” and promoting groundwater recharge. Dunes act as"
natural levees and help prevent coastal erosion. Natural resources such as these are being
engineered throughout the world to reduce impacts of flood events (see Section II for more
detail).
"The potential value of these natural resources, and the costs associated with re-engineering"
"them once lost, argue for the importance of their preservation. However, these resources are"
"not only under threat from human development, but also from nature. Sea level rise and"
"coastal erosion eat away at the extent of marshes, beaches and shallow water areas."
Understanding the future distribution of these resources is critical to maintaining their services.
There are a few tools in existence that can be used to understand coastal processes and the
impacts to natural resources in Virginia. Descriptions of these tools follow.

Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)
SLAMM was designed to model the effect of long-term sea level rise on wetland conversion and
"shoreline modifications. It uses national datasets, such as NOAA tidal data, U.S. Fish & Wildlife"
"Service National Wetland Inventory data, as well as local data, such as erosion rates, local rates"
of sea level rise and elevation data. Information about SLAMM can be found at:
http://www.warrenpinnacle.com/prof/SLAMM . SLAMM-View 2.0 is a web-based application
which allows comparisons of maps using different sea-level rise scenarios. It will also create a
report summarizing changes under different scenarios. SLAMM-View 2.0 can be found at:
http://www.slammview.org.
"In general, SLAMM projects are only run for small areas at a time. There are 2 projects on the"
SLAMM-View site that encompass parts of Virginia. These are 1) Chesapeake Bay Region
"(including Tangier Sound, the Eastern Shore, parts of the Lower and Middle Peninsula and"
Southside Hampton Roads; http://www.nwf.org/Global-Warming/Effects-on-Wildlife-and-
"Habitat/Estuaries-and-Coastal-Wetlands/Chesapeake-Bay.aspx) and 2) Chincoteague, Virginia"
Site (http://www.slammview.org/slammview2/reports/LDP_ChincoteagueFinal.pdf). The
"Chesapeake Bay Region model was run with LIDAR where available (however, Virginia LIDAR in"
2008 was limited; new and more extensive coverage of LIDAR exists at this time.) Using a 27.2
"inch sea level rise over 100 years, they reported the following results:"
