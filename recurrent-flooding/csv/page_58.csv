Limitations on Adaptation Authorities,
The use of any of these authorities for adaptation to increased flooding/sea level rise is limited,The use of any of these authorities for adaptation to increased flooding/sea level rise is limited
"by two major factors. First, with adaptation authorities based on state statute there are",
"potential limitations caused by the fact that in Virginia, localities only have the authorities",
"specifically given to them by the state, a constitutional approach referred to as “Dillon’s Rule.”","specifically given to them by the state, a constitutional approach referred to as “Dillon’s Rule.”"
Virginia Courts have held that “municipal governments have only those powers which are,
"expressly granted by the state legislature, those powers fairly or necessarily implied from",
"expressly granted powers, and those powers which are essential and indispensable”",
"(Commonwealth v. County Board of Arlington County, 217 Va. 558, 575, 232 S.E.2d 30, 41",
(1977)).,
This limitation becomes a significant factor in looking at the authorities available to local,
governments to adapt to future changes in inundation along the tidal shoreline. At the,
"regulatory end of the approaches described above, as localities attempt to change",
"development and redevelopment patterns through zoning and building codes, their actions",
may be subject to a constitutional challenge under the Dillon rule.,While general authority
"exists for localities to protect the health and welfare of their citizens, specific actions taken to",
restrict development on private property raise a set of issues that may need to be settled in,
"court, unless specific legislative authority is granted.",
"Second, all but one of the authorities outlined above share a significant challenge in",
anticipating future conditions since they use past conditions to predict the future and cannot,
anticipate changes beyond those past trends. With the exception of the US Army Corps of,
"Engineers Guidance, all of the statutes and regulations rely on a retrospective analysis of",
"flooding and sea level rise impacts. One-hundred year floodplains under FEMA programs, rates","flooding and sea level rise impacts. One-hundred year floodplains under FEMA programs, rates"
"of shoreline recession under the primary dune regulations, and all of the other regulatory",
analyses do not anticipate future conditions in their scope. Until these statutes and regulations,analyses do not anticipate future conditions in their scope. Until these statutes and regulations
