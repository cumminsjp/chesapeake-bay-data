"intensity rain events, rather than the total annual precipitation. High intensity rain events are"
typically the ones that lead to flooding. Scientists predict increasing storm intensity (leading to
"higher per storm precipitation), but the trend varies globally and even within the United States."
"Between 1948 and 2006, there appears to have been a 25% increase in the frequency of"
extreme precipitation events in Virginia (Madsen and Figdor 2007). Extending the dataset to
"2011, there appears to have been a 33% increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation"
"events, with the 1-year storm now occurring every 9 months (Madsen and Wilcox 2012). As the"
"frequency of extreme events has increased, so has the amount of rain that those storms"
"produce (i.e. the biggest storms are getting bigger), with Virginia seeing an 11% increase in"
precipitation from the largest storms between 1948 and 2011 (Madsen and Wilcox 2012).
Tropical storms
Much recent research has been done on the question of whether tropical storm activity is
increasing. Hurricane activity in the North Atlantic appears to have been increasing significantly
since 1995 (Nyberg et al. 2008) although the mechanism is unclear. Research on tropical
storms in the North Atlantic Basin suggest that there is an increase in storm activity in the 20 th
"century, but not necessarily an increase in storm intensity (i.e. proportion of hurricanes to"
tropical storms remain constant) (Holland and Webster 2007). It also is unresolved whether the
"increase in tropical storm activity is part of a cycle or is a return to normal hurricane activity,"
following a period of anomalously low activity in the 1970’s.
The only research found on tropical storm frequency in Virginia (making landfall) looks at data
from the 1800-1990’s and suggests that there is a 50-year cycle in the number of tropical
"storms and hurricanes, with the peak of the cycle lasting about 15 years (Roth and Cobb, year"
unknown). This concurs with other research suggesting that tropical storm tracks are driven by
"random fluctuations in atmospheric steering currents, making the data sets too “noisy” (filled"
with unexplained variations) to detect long-term trends in tropical storm landfall (Landsea
2005; Vecchi and Knutson 2011).
Winter Storms
Most of the storm tides with a 10-yr return period magnitude in coastal Virginia are caused by
winter storms (or nor’easters) (Ho et al. 1976) making them a critical driver of the most
"frequent storm surges (Boon 2012). In the United States, the average loss per storm (in $$) as"
well as the average storm intensity (measured as numbers of states impacted by a single storm)
"appears to be increasing (Changnon 2007). In Virginia, winter storm occurrences between 1984"
"and 2003 were 130% higher than during the previous 20 year time period, potentially related to"
a southern shift in the Arctic front in the latter time period (Changnon 2007). Research on 50
years of data suggests that the annual frequency of the strongest nor’easters is related to the
