"Critical Facilities Flood Exposure tool, NOAA Coastal Services Center: Digital Coast"
"This tool provides an assessment of a community’s critical facilities (schools, fire stations, etc.)"
"and road miles within the FEMA 100-year flood zone (1% annual chance of flooding), using"
FEMA data for the flood zones and 2000-2001 FEMA HAZUS-MH data (see below) for the
facilities. Results are presented both as maps and as tables. It can be found at:

"Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard (HAZUS-MH), Federal Emergency Management Agency"
"HAZUs-MH is a nationally applicable, standardized method for estimating losses from natural"
"disasters, including floods. Potential loss estimates include: physical damage to buildings and"
infrastructure; economic losses including business interruptions; and social impacts (shelter
"requirements, displaced households, etc.). It maps the limits of high-risk locations, allowing"
users to visualize the relationship to populations. It can be used to assess the reduction in
losses associated with certain adaptation strategies. One of the current limitations of HAZUS-
"MH is the use of old census data, which makes the analysis underestimate impacts in regions"
"that have recently seen increased growth. However, FEMA is currently updating HAZUS-MH"
"with 2010 census data, which should help alleviate concerns in that area. It can be obtained at:"
http://www.fema.gov/hazus.
Although some localities have done vulnerability analyses and prioritized areas for adaptation
"strategy adoption, at this time, there is no comprehensive analysis of coastal vulnerability."
"It is important to note that vulnerability is not a static measure, but will change over time. As"
"populations grow and new development continues, the magnitude of consequences from a"
"given flood event will change. In addition, sea level is predicted to rise faster in some parts of"
"Virginia, changing likelihood of flooding in certain areas relative to other areas. Therefore,"
some prediction of future conditions may help prioritize flooding adaptation efforts.
Predictions of future impacts: Changing precipitation and storm surge
Predictions of changes in precipitation are a complicated subject because they have two
"components, one is the number of storms that occur and the other is the intensity of the"
"storms. In Virginia, both tropical systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) and extratropical"
systems (nor’easters and winter storms) can drop significant amounts of precipitation in a short
time period.
"Both types of storm systems also create storm surge, the primary component of coastal"
"flooding. Storm surge is affected by storm intensity, size, speed, central pressure, angle of"
"approach, shape of the coastline, slope of the offshore area and the complexity of the shoreline"
"(inlets, bays, etc.) This means every storm produces a unique storm surge, making them"
"difficult to model and predict. On the open coast, fast moving storms tend to produce a higher"
