where a locality wants to discourage development and redevelopment) are transferred to
another parcel (where this development is preferred). This tool is used to preserve open space
or protect natural resources and could be a way of keeping development out of inundation
zones while allowing property owners to recoup some of their investment. Virginia allows
localities to authorize the transfer of development rights at Code of Virginia § 15.2-2316.2.
Owners of developed land in areas of high risk of inundation have vested rights in the current
"land use, a land use that may be increasingly at risk with sea level rise. Amortizing those vested"
rights over time – in a phase out period – allows the landowner to recoup investment but
moves those nonconforming land uses out of high risk inundation zones over time. Courts have
recognized a reasonable amortization period as preventing a “takings” claim wherein the
property owner seeks full compensation for the loss of the higher use of their land. Vested
rights are discussed at Code of Virginia § 15.2-2307.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) operates the National Flood Insurance
"Program (NFIP), a significant economic force in shoreline areas at risk from inundation, with"
flood insurance required in high flood risk zones. Eligibility for the NFIP is already conditioned
on a locality undertaking a number of adaptation measures for existing flooding risks (see both
"planning and regulatory sections). If properly focused on sea level rise inundation, this program"
could create additional incentives directed at adaptation to sea level rise risk. A federal study
"was recently completed to determine the impacts of climate change on the NFIP and, while not"
"released, is reported to estimate a 40 to 45 percent increase in mandatory coverage with sea"
"level rise projections. In addition, the recently enacted reauthorization of the NFIP requires a"
study on how FEMA would include projections of sea level rise into their flood rate insurance
maps.
"Virginia, like all states, regulates the private insurance industry. Insurance cost and availability"
"sends a strong market signal to areas with high risk of inundation, and as insurance companies"
"set rates and determine availability, these decisions will affect adaptation responses. With"
"more expensive insurance and/or limited availability, property and business owners in high risk"
"zones may seek other, safer areas to live and operate businesses or may seek insurance policies"
"that reward adaptation. At present, private sector providers of wind insurance have begun to"
limit coverage in coastal areas in Virginia or have withdrawn completely from some areas. If
"these actions continue, they may begin to shape investment patterns along the tidal shoreline"
"in Virginia and create a new set of financial incentives/disincentives. Conversely, state action to"
moderate these price signals along the shoreline could reverse needed adaptation measures.
"In areas of high risk from inundation, expenses will rise to provide public services necessary to"
maintain current land uses and landowner expectations. When those costs increase to
"significant levels, local government budgets may become compromised. One way to offset and"
