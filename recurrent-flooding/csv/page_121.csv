"The long range, end-of-the-century forecasts have significant uncertainty, with projections for"
our region of a sea level rise anywhere between 1.5 and 7.5 feet. These projections are based
on the U.S. National Climate Assessment which has generated four scenarios of global sea level
for its 2013 report to Congress (Parris et al. 2012). By adding what we know about land
"subsidence in the Virginia coastal region, we are able to develop regional scenarios to inform"
planning and adaptation efforts. The scenarios are shown in Figure 16. They all begin with the
documented sea levels in 1992. The lowest curve (labeled “current”) represents a simple
extrapolation of the historic average rate of rise. The top curve (labeled “highest”) represents
the physically possible circumstance that would occur with rapid melting of all the earth’s
"glaciers and ice caps, essentially a worst case scenario. The middle two curves are based on"
models of the global system’s response to either significant efforts by the world’s nations to
"reduce greenhouse gases (the “low” curve), or business as usual (the “high” curve). Recent"
trends in Virginia sea levels suggest we are on the “high” curve. Whether this rate of increase
"will be sustained is uncertain, but it does inform thinking about the Commonwealth’s future."
"Given what is currently known, it seems reasonable to anticipate that sea level in Virginia will"
be 1.5 feet higher than it is presently sometime in the next 20 to 50 years. This is a time frame
that makes consideration of potential impacts relevant for home mortgages and most public
"infrastructure (e.g. roads, schools, fire stations)."
