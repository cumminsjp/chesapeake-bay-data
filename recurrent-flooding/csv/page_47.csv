"rates exceed those of the recharge, issues such as land subsidence and salt intrusion into",
freshwater aquifers begin to occur. Land subsidence occurs through the compaction of the,
"ground when empty aquifers slowly collapse down. In coastal aquifers, salt intrusion into",
drinking water supplies occurs when a reversal of groundwater flow causes seawater to be,
pulled into the aquifers (http://ca.water.usgs.gov/misc/asr/),

Multiple strategies approach and Flexible adaptation pathways,
Two of the most important lessons that can be learned from a review of global adaptation,
strategies are that a multi-layered approach to flood prevention is most effective and that,
"when predictions of the future are uncertain, flexible plans for adaptation are imperative.",
