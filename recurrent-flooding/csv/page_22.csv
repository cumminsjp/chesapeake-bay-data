team that developed the scenarios for the National Climate Assessment (Parris et al. 2012),
"indicated the high scenario should allow assessment of risk from limited ice sheet loss, while",
the low scenario represents risk primarily from ocean warming.,
Using the National Climate Assessment sea level rise scenarios modified for conditions in,
"Virginia, we recommend anticipating a sea level rise in Virginia of approximately 1.5 feet over",
the next 20 to 50 years.,
Consequences for Recurrent Flooding in Virginia,
Considering the projections for all of the factors that drive recurrent flooding in Virginia –,
"precipitation, storm frequency, and sea level rise – the frequency and severity of flooding",
events is only likely to increase.,Sea level rise will make it easier for the current patterns of
weather events to generate damaging flood events in the future. Increases in storm intensity,
"and/or frequency will only aggravate that circumstance. For these reasons, serious",
consideration of adaptation options should be a priority.,
