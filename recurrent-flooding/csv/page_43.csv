Time horizons,
Time horizons for planning activities are important mainly in areas where sea level rise is,
expected to create or worsen flooding issues. The challenge in picking appropriate time,

projections complicates the decision making process and makes choosing the right planning,
horizon critical (IWR 2011). Preparing for the worst case may result in significant over,
"expenditures, while under expenditures could lead to avoidable catastrophic consequences.",
"In looking at projected flood issues and adaptation strategies in Asia, The World Bank (2010)",
used a 40-year planning horizon because they felt this appropriately reflected city-level,
planning horizons and the typical time frame for major flood protection measures. This is,
"similar to the general planning horizon used in the Netherlands, which is 50 years. The",
rationale for the 50 year planning horizon is to minimize uncertainty in sea level rise,
"projections, while still using a long enough time frame for the investment required in large",
flood protection measures.,
Multiple planning horizons and “Adaptive Deltamanagement” is used in the Netherlands,
(http://www.deltacommissaris.nl/english/topics/adaptive_deltamanagement/) to help,
minimize the impacts of uncertainty. This requires taking short term measures that tie into,
long term measures. Working with multiple strategies on different time scales is a flexible,
approach which allows for switches in management with changing conditions. This allows them,approach which allows for switches in management with changing conditions. This allows them
to postpone major works until they have increased confidence in the climate change,
projections (IWR 2011).,The following “design” horizons are used for projects requiring
significant improvement or construction.,
Small projects or dike improvements,10-50 years
"Capital works (sluices, locks)",100 years
Major works (storm surge barriers),200 years
"For public water supply utilities, the following time frames are recommended for consideration","For public water supply utilities, the following time frames are recommended for consideration"
during the decision making process (PWSUCIWG 2012):,
Operations decisions,>3 years
Capital expense,3-6 years
Comprehensive planning,10 years
Water supply planning,20 years
Water treatment plant construction,50 years
