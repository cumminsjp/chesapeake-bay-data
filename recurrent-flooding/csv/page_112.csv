the Accomack-Northampton Planning District Commission (2011). Hazard Mitigation Plan--The
Eastern Shore of Virginia. http://www.a-npdc.org/hazardplan.pdf). A typical regional hazard
"mitigation plan includes a hazard analysis, a vulnerability risk assessment, and a capability"
assessment. A few localities such as Chesapeake and Poquoson have their own plans but for the
most part the HMPs are regionally focused.
The IPCC (1990) recommendations for National Coastal Planning include four goals for local
"governments’ coastal planning efforts. First, coastal localities should implement comprehensive"
coastal zone management plans. Most of the hazard mitigation plans fail to address adverse
effects on the coastal zone due to land subsidence and sea level rise. Even far reaching plans
such as the City of Hampton’s Comprehensive Waterways Management Plan lack a
comprehensive study of current and probable future tidal flooding impacts in the city’s flood
prone areas. Still comprehensive coastal management plans need to extend beyond the
"borders of one locality and look at an entire watershed or region. In addition to the HMP, many"
"localities have comprehensive planning, disaster recovery plans, emergency operations plans,"
"floodplain management plans, stormwater management plans, green infrastructure plans, open"
"space management plans, and water supply plans, which hopefully will further the mitigation"
goals.
"Second, the IPCC recommends local governments identify coastal areas at risk. All of the hazard"
"mitigation plans do a thorough job identifying areas at risk, inventorying structures at risk and"
recognizing changing coastal hazards. IPCC also recommends localities should ensure that
coastal development does not increase vulnerability to flooding. The National Flood Insurance
Program’s main goal is to reduce flood damages and protect people and their property from
"unwise floodplain development through floodplain management regulations, which is"
reiterated in every hazard mitigation plan but some localities have passed more conservative
"regulations to restrict new development in vulnerable areas. Finally, according to IPCC’s"
"recommendations, emergency preparedness and coastal zone response mechanisms should be"
reviewed and strengthened. The hazard mitigation plans definitely focus on emergency
"preparedness mechanisms by addressing emergency alert systems, evacuation protocols and"
operations plans.
"The hazard mitigation plans predominately focus on risk assessments, which usually includes an"
"inventory of critical facilities, chronology of storm hazard events, and repetitive loss estimates"
"by locality but the exact methodology tends to vary by region. A typical risk assessment, such"
"as in Poquoson, evaluates the probability of occurrence, location, extent, magnitude and"
likelihood of a hazard for a given community. Whereas a vulnerability assessment estimates
the extent of injury and damage that may result from a hazard event of a given intensity.
Vulnerability assessments adjust for the fact that a hazard event that occurs in a highly
