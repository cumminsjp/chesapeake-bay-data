Stakeholders would like to see the state involved in the following ways:,Stakeholders would like to see the state involved in the following ways:
1),They would like the state to review state policies that encourage development in flood
,"prone areas. Specifically, they mentioned the changes in the state health codes that"
,allow engineered septic systems in areas that were previously unsuitable for use. Many
,"of these areas are flood prone; however, the localities feel that they do not have the"
,authority to deny development if the state will allow septic systems.
2),They would like the state to decide for the localities what rate of sea level rise to use for
,"planning purposes. Ideally, they would like the state to issue maps of sea level rise"
,impacts at different times in the future (for different planning windows). This would
,give localities defined boundaries for planning efforts.
3),They are concerned how communities (especially rural ones) will finance adaptation
,strategies. They would like to see state leadership on this issue.
4),They would like to see the state (through the Virginia Department of Transportation)
,develop a comprehensive plan for the management of recurrently flooding roads. There
,"are concerns that as sea level rise makes flooding worse on coastal roads, the state will"
,"choose to abandon them, leaving the localities responsible for raising or maintaining the"
,roads.
