Using multiple strategies to reduce flood damage is a comprehensive approach that builds a
"certain level of redundancy into the protection system. In the Netherlands, there has recently"
been a shift in the core element of their flood damage reduction plans from protection to risk
management (Councils for the Environment and Infrastructure 2010). This is a more
comprehensive approach that seeks to manage flood consequences (e.g. development in the
"floodplain) as well as provide protection from floods. Therefore, it necessitates the use of"
"multiple strategies, such as taking into account the probability of a flood, spatial planning, and"
"disaster mitigation (emergency services) This approach, while more comprehensive, also"
necessitates a great deal of coordination and cooperation among different agencies and
entities (van den Heuval et al 2011) .
Because no adaptation strategy (other than abandonment) completely removes the risk of
"flood damage, multi-level adaptation strategies allow states to decide on priorities (typically"
"protection, but can be management and planning) and then to “buy-down” the remaining risk"
"using other strategies. These can be visualized as a staircase, in which each step results in some"
"reduction in risk. In this approach, a storm surge barrier might be the initial adaptation, and"
other adaptations would include elevating structures and investing in emergency management
"(both to reduce consequences of a levee failure). Each step would reduce risk to some extent,"
together resulting in lower risk than any single measure. In areas with low-intensity
"development and little money for adaptations, the initial step might be stringent regulations on"
new development to keep it away from floodplains and additional steps might be an early
warning system and a detailed evacuation plan. Good plans should include some consideration
"of protection, spatial planning/management and emergency services."
"In most cases, adaptation measures will require significant investment, making it imperative to"
conduct rigorous assessments of cost- and flood reduction effectiveness. But calculation of
future risk is uncertain (due to inherent uncertainty in the timing and extent of climate change
"impacts), emphasizing the need for development of Flexible Adaptation Pathways (LeBlanc and"
"Linkin 2010). These are pathways that are that are low regret, reversible, or incorporate"
margins of error.
"An example is the Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) Plan, which contains a schedule of alternate"
"adaptation options, triggered by changes in 10 flood-risk parameters (Wilby and Dessai 2010)."
"Because there is uncertainty attached to estimates of each of these parameters, the plan is"
"phased, with the first phase being maintenance of existing defenses, the second phase being"
replacement of existing defenses and new structures waiting until the third phase (Wilby and
"Dessai 2010). This allows the plan to change (e.g. alterations to new defenses, no new"
"defenses, or acceleration of the phases) if conditions change from projected. Flexible"
