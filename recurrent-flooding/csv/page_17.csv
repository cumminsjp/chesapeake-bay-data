Maps of the potentially flooded areas were analyzed to assess:,
,the proportion of each coastal locality that was at risk for increasingly frequent flooding
,over the next 30 to 50 years;
,the proportion of the potentially flooded area that is currently classified as developed
,land; and
,"the number of miles of primary, secondary, and tertiary roads within the potentially"
,flooded area of each locality.
,This information is summarized in the table below (Table of Coastal Vulerability to
,Predicted Sea Level Rise and Vulerability). On the basis of these parameters many of
,"the coastal localities are confronting significant challenges, particularly the cities of"
,"Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, Hampton, and Poquoson, as well as"
,the counties of Accomack and Mathews. It is important to remember in reviewing these
,numbers that these are analyses based on current development patterns and
,"populations. Change is anticipated in both of these factors, and that change also will"
,not be uniform across all localities. This indicates a need for an iterating risk assessment
,to inform policy and management.
