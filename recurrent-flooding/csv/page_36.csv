,Pros:,
,o,"Large areas can be protected by levees, makes them very appropriate for urban"
,,areas
,o,"They can be planned for future expansion, making them relatively future-proof"
,o,"Properly designed and maintained, they can be very effective"
,Cons:,
,o,They are only as strong as their weakest point
,o,"Unless the area is being newly developed or redeveloped, they require"
,,acquisition of large pieces of shoreline
,o,"They are expensive and require on-going maintenance, so they can be cost"
,,"prohibitive, particularly in areas of low-intensity development"
,o,"They break the connection between the upland and the shoreline, and reduce"
,,access to the water
,o,They are prone to failure when floodwaters exceed design standards
