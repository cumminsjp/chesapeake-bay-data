A baywide area estimate could be computed by subtracting the partial totals that are included in the 2011 areas,,,,,
and adding on the 2010 reported area for the regions not mapped in 2011.,,,,,

We're providing it to note the potential bias in using the 2010 area estimate since SAV has declined in these regions.,,,,,
