Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2011: Only 57,964 acres were mapped in 2011. It is estimated that an additional 5,119 acres may have been present (for an estimated total of 63,083), however, they could not be mapped since SAV signatures were masked by excess turbidity present months after the passage of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. The regions that were not mapped are contained within nine CBP segments, including the Middle, Upper and Western Branch of the Patuxent River; the Middle and Upper Potomac River; Piscataway Creek; and the Anacostia River.  The estimated additional acreage is based on acreages mapped in those regions in 2010. Zone and density totals do NOT include estimated additional acreage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2006:  all historic acreage was corrected using 2.4711 as the conversion from hectares to acres.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2005:  On 5/24/05, Dave Wilcox noted an error in the reported estimated additional acres for 2003.  This reduced the the estimate from 3,015 to 1,832 and resulted in a revised total (reduced from 64,710 to 63,524",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2005:  All historic acreage data was corrected using 2.471 as the conversion from hectares to acres.  Previously, from 1978-1999, 2.47 was used and from 2000-2004, 2.4711 was used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2003:  Only 61,695 acres were mapped baywide in 2003.  It is estimated that an additional 1,832 acres may have been present (for an estimated baywide total of 63,527), however, they could not be mapped since some portions of the Bay were not flown due to adverse weather in the spring and summer and Hurricane Isabel in the fall. These regions, including Tavern and Swan creeks; lower Chester River; upper Wicomico River; Prentice, Dividing, and Ball creeks; Dameron Marsh; and Great Wicomico River were not fully mapped in 2003. The estimated additional acreage is based on acreages mapped in those regions in 2002.  Zone and density totals do NOT include estimated additional acreage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*2001:  Only 77,889 acres were mapped baywide in 2001. It is estimated that an additional 7,525 acres may have been present (for an estimated baywide total of 85,415), however, they could not be surveyed due to flight restrictions following September 11.  The estimated additional acreage is based on acreages mapped in those regions in 2000. Zone and density totals do NOT include estimated additional acreage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*1999: Only 64,718 acres were mapped baywide in 1999.  It is estimated that an additional 3,382 acres may have been present (for an estimated baywide total of 69,000), however, they could not be mapped due to the following: either flown too late in 1999, due to poor atmospheric conditions and severe storm events, or not flown until after an early seasonal die-back in freshwater SAV species, possibly a result of increased salinity during the drought and severe storm events. Those areas include Spesutie Narrows, the Bush, Gunpowder, upper Patuxent, lower Magothy, upper York and upper James rivers, and the Swan Point and Tavern Creek area. The estimated additional acreage is based on acreages mapped in those regions in 1998. Zone and density totals do NOT include estimated additional acreage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*1998 acreage includes previously unsampled portions of the James, York and Rappahannock: 906 acres that were not included in previous totals ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*1997 zone/density acreage updated 6/3/98 (preliminary numbers),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*1996 zone data revised 6/3/98 (segment changes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Zone data prior to 1996 revised 4/17/00 due to newly adopted Bay segmentation scheme in 1997.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1986: Only 47,414 acres were mapped baywide in 1986.  It is estimated that an additional 276 acres may have been present (for an estimated baywide total of 47,690), however, they could not be mapped due to flight restrictions around Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Where available, the previous and subsequent year’s data were averaged to generate estimated additional acreage. Please refer to “SAV Area Estimates for Missing 1984 and 1986 Quadrangles Technical Note 12/15/97” for details.  Zone and density totals do NOT include estimated additional acreage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1984: Only 38,228 acres were mapped baywide in 1984.  It is estimated that an additional 731 acres may have been present (for an estimated baywide total of 38,958), however, they could not be mapped due to flight restrictions around Patuxent Naval Air, camera malfunction and missing digital files. Where available, the previous and subsequent year’s data were averaged to generate estimated additional acreage. Please refer to “SAV Area Estimates for Missing 1984 and 1986 Quadrangles Technical Note 12/15/97” for details.  Zone and density totals do NOT include estimated additional acreage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
