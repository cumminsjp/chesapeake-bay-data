Maps are effective ways of conveying information. A,
map can highlight geographical patterns in data by,
showing the relationship between what is happening,
and where it is happening. The maps in this atlas,
combine contextual information (such as boundary,
lines) with thematic information (such as demographic,
or economic statistics). This combination of contextual,
and thematic information helps the reader observe,
general trends inherent in the distribution of data. For,
"example, a map that shows the population growth rate",
for each county in the region may reveal that many of,
the highest growth rates are concentrated in counties,
close to the bay.,
"Each map, together with tabular data and other",
"graphics, is designed to allow for easy comparison, so",
readers can see how conditions and trends in their own,
counties compare with those in other counties and,
relate to larger regional patterns. The consistent map,
design allows readers to make comparisons among two,
"or more maps. For example, comparing maps of federal",
expenditures per person and poverty rates might reveal,
that federal expenditures tend to be higher in a region’s,
poorer counties.,
