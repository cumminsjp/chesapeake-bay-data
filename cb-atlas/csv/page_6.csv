This socioeconomic atlas is one component in that,
"effort. It is a tool for managers, planners, community",
"leaders, and others to use in addressing the challenge",
of preserving the natural and cultural resources of the,
Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic,
Trail and other areas throughout the Chesapeake,
Bay Watershed. Part of that challenge involves,
understanding conditions in the region surrounding,
the watershed – conditions which can have significant,
impacts on its resources. Systematic study and,
"monitoring of regional conditions involves, to a large",
"degree, investigation of human activities. This atlas",
"focuses on such human activities, characterizing",
them in terms of standardized measures known as,
socioeconomic indicators.,
