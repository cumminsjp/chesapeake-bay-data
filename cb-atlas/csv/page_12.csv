"socioeconomic indicators described above, a menu of 67",presented in this atlas. Appendix 2 provides technical
socioeconomic indicators was developed. Each indicator,information on the design of the maps. Appendix 3
was determined to be readily available and mappable at,includes endnotes and text that provide additional
the county level.,information on the measurement of selected indicators.
"From this menu, 17 core indicators were selected",
that are common to all atlases published through this,
project. The core indicators provide information useful,
to all park and trail managers.,
Incorporating these core indicators throughout the,
series of atlases enables comparisons among national,
park units in different regions of the country. NPS,
Chesapeake Bay Program managers and their partners,
from other agencies chose additional indicators from,
the menu described above. Managers selected these,
indicators to customize the atlas so that it would target,
information relevant to their particular management,
needs. Figure 1 shows the six general categories and,
the specific indicators included in this atlas; for each,
"category, indicators are listed in the order they appear in",
the atlas.,
The maps in this atlas are based on county-level data,
wherever possible. County-level data have several,
"advantages. Good quality data are available at this scale,",
"are consistently collected at regular intervals, and are",
"comparable across all U.S. counties. Also, counties are",
"stable geographic units for monitoring trends, as few",
changes are made to county boundaries over time.,
"Finally, as administrative and political units, counties",
significantly influence environmental change and can be,
important partners in park and trail management.,
