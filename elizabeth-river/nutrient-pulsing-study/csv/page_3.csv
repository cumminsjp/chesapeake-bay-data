,Factors promoting algal blooms
Our previous research has shown....,
•,Cochlodinium polykrikoides is dominant summer
,bloom former (other species also co-exist and
,bloom at times)
•,Summer blooms tend to follow storm events
•,Optimal water temperatures
•,Quiescent – stagnant conditions
•,Stratified water column
•,Blooms often initiate in the LAF headwaters and
,spread to mainstem ER and lower James

,Objectives of present study
•,Measure stormwater inputs
•,Measure effects of storms on the river
,– Continuous monitoring (CMON)
,– Temporally intensive sampling on piers
,– Spatially extensive monitoring by boat
•,Relate inputs and storms effects to blooms
•,Focus on Lafayette River since headwaters are
,often the initiation grounds for blooms
•,Results should be transferable to similar systems
