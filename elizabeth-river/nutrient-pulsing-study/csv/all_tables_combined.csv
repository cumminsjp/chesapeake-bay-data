,,James River Study
Big picture objectives:,Big picture objectives:,
•,Re-evaluate the existing chlorophyll a criteria,
,and standards,
•,Improve related modeling (WSM and CHLA),
•,2017: Provide basis for revised James River,
,2023 nutrient allocations in the Bay TMDL,

,James River Study (Lower Estuary Portion),
•,Monitoring,
,–,"Dataflow, continuous monitors, fixed sites"
•,Phytoplankton,
,–,Identification and enumeration
,–,HPLC pigments
•,Environmental factors favoring algal blooms,
,–,Nutrient pulse (subject for today)
,–,Nutrient uptake
,–,Nutrient exchange from bottom sediments
•,Effects studies,
,–,Lab toxicity testing
,–,Field studies (oyster cages)
•,Modeling improvements,
,–,Watershed model
,–,CHLA / HAB model

,Factors promoting algal blooms
Our previous research has shown....,
•,Cochlodinium polykrikoides is dominant summer
,bloom former (other species also co-exist and
,bloom at times)
•,Summer blooms tend to follow storm events
•,Optimal water temperatures
•,Quiescent – stagnant conditions
•,Stratified water column
•,Blooms often initiate in the LAF headwaters and
,spread to mainstem ER and lower James
,5
,Objectives of present study
•,Measure stormwater inputs
•,Measure effects of storms on the river
,– Continuous monitoring (CMON)
,– Temporally intensive sampling on piers
,– Spatially extensive monitoring by boat
•,Relate inputs and storms effects to blooms
•,Focus on Lafayette River since headwaters are
,often the initiation grounds for blooms
•,Results should be transferable to similar systems

Stormwater,

Stormwater – Colonial Place,
Gosnold and New York Ave - ~21 acres drainage area,
Suburban land use,
Recent rain gauge additions not shown,8
Stormwater – WHRO
"Near WHRO, behind ODU dorm - ~122 acre drainage area"
Institutional land use

,ISCO stormwater details
•,Equipment is set up when forecasts are
,favorable (i.e. >=50% chance and >0.1”
,forecast)
•,Samples collected sequentially by time and
,manually composited by flow (flow weighted)
•,"Samples collected for TSS, nutrients (TN, TP,"
,"NH3, NO3+NO3, OPO4), and salinity"

,Pier sampling details
•,ISCO samplers set up when forecasts are favorable
,(coincides with SW deployment)
•,“Prior” samples collected at equipment set up
•,Sampler triggers by rain gauge (@0.1”/hr)
•,"Samples collected sequentially by time intervals @ (0,"
,"30 min, hourly, every 2 hrs, every 4 hrs, every 6 hrs) -"
,out to 48 hours – sometimes extended
,– Idea is to collect samples frequently since nutrients can be
,rapidly assimilated by phytoplankton
•,"Parameters: NH4, NO2+NO3, PO4, TDN with analysis"
,by ODU
•,Concurrent daily sampling by ODU (nutrients and
,phytoplankton)
,16
,,Continuous Monitors
•,YSI 6600 V2 EDS,
•,Weekly sonde exchanges,
,–,Swap out instruments (requires 2 sondes for each site)
,–,Collect QC information
,–,Clean and re-calibrate instruments
,–,Data review and troubleshooting if needed
•,Sonde data is recorded at 15 min intervals for,
,"depth, temp, salinity, do, pH, CHLA, and Turb",
•,Data is validated and reported to VECOS,

,Boat sampling details
•,"Boat was deployed “prior”, 1 day after, and 2"
,days after storms
•,Dataflow results were logged
•,Fixed site nutrient grabs collected + QC
•,Vertical profiling conducted
